2231,"I like the Swingline thermal photo lamination pouches. They seal fine. This is a good choice to preserve the photo that gets tucked up on the mirror, or pinned up on the wall. The price for a twenty-pouch pack seems reasonable, and is great for those who like to have some photo pouches on hand, but regular users may find a significant saving with bulk packages. These perform well for their intended purpose."
2231,"It's not too bad for an inexpensive packaging tape dispenser - replacing the roll couldn't be easier. For something that doesn't cost too much, it's a handy little dispenser.I have big hands so this is not the best solution for me to be using for extended periods of time; after a while it can start to hurt. On the plus side, it's small and easy to keep out of the way, and the light blue color sticks out like a sore thumb to make for easy spotting among packaging materials and other things.This is ideal to have around any office. It's fine to use in hands of any size to tape a couple of packages or fewer per day. Unless you have small hands, I recommend a more substantial tape dispenser like the3M Scotch Gray Box Sealing Tape Dispenserfor consistent, high-volume use."
2231,"I've been enjoying the Scotch Adhesive Dot Roller. It's incredibly easy to use: just fold back the flap and swipe some sticky onto a surface. As easy as it is to roll on, it's probably best to roll a series of smaller strips to conserve the forty-nine feet worth of dots.It's a light-duty adhesive, perfect for sticking papers and photos onto stuff. It's great in situations which would normally require double-sided tape.The refills consist of an entire plastic adhesive roll cartridge which is easy enough to remove and install and significantly less expensive than the Dot Roller itself. I'm unaware of any environmental advantages this would have over traditional strip tape.I'm satisfied with the convenience and simplicity of this product."
2231,"It's easy to open; just screw the two-part cap on all the way to puncture the foil. It's easy to apply; just remove the top portion of the two-part cap to reveal the long narrow precision application nozzle, clean and dry the surface in need of adhesive, line up the applicator tip with the surface and gently squeeze the sides of the bottle. A reasonable amount of glue ends up only where it's expected to go.I love the no-mess bottle, which is much cleaner and easier than using the classic tube-only style. I shall no longer fear accidentally gluing my fingertips to things."
2231,"These Scotch Reusable Tabs are perfect!Each tab is qualified to hold up to .25 lb, so I guess I'll skip the load testing I had planned. Instead, I'll try throwing a curveball by using an unintended alternate material - polyester!I bought a couple of light, nature imagery, polyester flags to use on my boat windows as a sunscreen and privacy curtain, and I figured if these adhesives worked, it would be absolutely perfect...and, as you may see in the uploaded photo, they work great! Even after I remove them and reapply them to the material, they stick on incredibly strong.These reusable tabs adhere perfectly to paper, photos, glass and refrigerators as surely they originally had in mind.I highly recommend these versatile Scotch Reusable Tabs for any lightweight mounting needs you may have - don't stick tacks in your wall...stick reusable tabs on them instead!"
2231,"I like these 3M shipping labels. I got all my Christmas shipping done using them, and they adhere quite nicely to the boxes and padded envelopes I used.I still have several sheets left, and I'm sure that the 250 included 2"" x 4"" labels will go a long way for someone who regularly sends packages.These print a clean, sharp label through mySamsung Laser Printer. They didn't smudge or jam on me. I'm happy with them."
2231,"This tape dispenser is fantastic. I find the precut strips to be very convenient for gift wrapping - the ability to always keep one hand on the package is very helpful. The unique, soft suction cup holds the tape dispenser in place on flat surfaces, yet allows it to slide off smoothly for easy relocation. It's both compact and easy to load.The sticky sides of the strips alternate as they come up out of the dispenser - I've lost track as I've gone, but it's so easy to use that I don't worry about it. Tape misers can no longer use the tooth marks left by traditional dispensers to tear the strips in half lengthwise, but it's alright because it provides a cleaner application anyway.I like the Scotch refillable pop-up tape dispenser."
2231,"I love the Reveal-N-Seal Business Envelopes! There's no need to taste glue; I just lift the flap which is covering the sticky seal, then fold over the main flap to close the envelope and there's no mess whatsoever. They seal up beautifully...nice and flat. I feel secure about the privacy of the contents of my mail with the printed interior.These are exceptional, high-quality envelopes and I am extremely satisfied with them."
2231,"These are useful enough. I'm not going to tout them as spectacular or beyond my wildest dreams, but these laptop note dispensers are an inexpensive solution to keeping something handy to write on.They're simple, attractive, compact and unobtrusive. If you're one to regularly scribble down notes, you'll like these too."
2231,"This is a nice, strong, quality binder, but do keep in mind that it is very large. It's not ideal for a small collection of papers to refer to, but rather it is perfect for a large collection of organized documents.There are four interior pockets for convenient access, two on each cover. This binder's rings are situated on the rightmost page, with male pegs to female inlets as opposed to the squiggly s-connector used in many binders that papers sometimes work their way into, or worse yet, out of. I thought the papers might work their way underneath the ""L"" portion of the clips where they attach to the binder, but they do not. Papers reside harmoniously fold-free within this binder.This binder is too big for my immediate needs, but that doesn't affect my positive feedback for the product - it's a fantastic, durable three-ring binder."
2231,"Mounting is simple using the Velcro-like Command strips which allow the dispenser to be easily removed from the wall to fill with new Pop-ups. Unfortunately, the Velcro is so dense and short that the slighted bump can cause it to drop to the floor, so if over a tile floor, I suspect it may crack the dispenser.I have much more empty wall than empty desktop space, so I'm very pleased with the utility of these quality designed wall-mountable Pop-ups dispensers."
270,"While the glossy tape that I use at the office is good for keeping things together, it shows up very easily on gift wrap, being all shiny.  The matte or satin finsh on this is perfect for gifts..  doesnt attract or reflect light, so that you see the wrapping paper and not the tape. Very simple and it works.Con:  this type of tape is really for gift wrapping and isnt as attractive for normal everyday use, but it can be used as such.  Get both scotch gift tape and scotch regualr tape and you will have the right tape for the right occasion."
270,"With the new mice that dont need mouse pads (they even track on glass),  you can reall y miss the wrist support of a wrist mouse pad.  But this eliminates that problem..  its a wrist support that allows me not to have a mouse pad.Pros: size is perfectCons... only in black..."
270,"We have used these with the Scotch Pro Thermal Laminator with great success.  The pouches are easy to use, with a single opening and feed easily through the laminator.  The resulting laminate page is uniform and we havent had any of the items that we laminate pull apart.  Its a great way for us to keep important art projects from our kids to survive forever.Cons...  none that I can think of.  The price is reasonable and it works as expected."
270,"Highlighters are higlighters, except when they have some nice conveniences...  I really love the fact that these are retractible... no more losing the cap or not fastening the cap tight enough to prevent the market from drying out.. and you can saftly have these in a pocket without any worry.  They are no smear, as advertised, but that's expected out of any decent highlighter."
270,"3M certainly does permanent well.  These will not come off without your favorite steam iron technique.Easy to feed into an inkjet and problem free, templates availible online and inside my Office 2010 beta for Word and Publisher.These were obviously made for inkjet printing and take ink and feed well."
270,"This is the solution to easy gift wrapping...  a quick pull for a perfect strip of tape.  Unlike a traditional tape dispenser with a roll and a cutter, each strip is precut and uniform.  This provides both quicker tape pulls, and the tape is no longer cut with a serrated edge that remains raised.Note the unit is not heavy enough to counter weight the force of pulling a tape from the dispenser, the bottom of the dispenser has a suction base, which works well on smooth surfaces, but would not work on rough or uneven surfaces, requiring two hands for operation.Also.. kinda of fun to use, even more so for a curious 3-yr old that throughly enjoyed the magic of the tape dispenser.Recommended for gift wrapping,  but wouldnt replace a traditional desk dispensor for longer strips or cheaper refills."
270,"My kids wanted to have concert tickets for their party, and while you can buy mock up tickets from a party outlet store, these Avery tickets let you create custom tickets for the ""event"".While Avery has 30-some pre-made sample word based tickets, I used photoshop to create a cool layered .png file with their pictures and appropriate rockstar concert look.  Then ported the graphic to the 16154 word template.. The kids loved working with me on the design and playing with the results in their mock concert/dance party.Even though we used them for pay and fun, its very possible to make professional looking tickets, pre-printed for guests, seat locations, etc."
270,These labels are the perfect size for printing out prepaid ups or usps labels.  My biggest challenge is that most prepaid shippers do not send the labels in a format that is easily trasnferred to the template.  A little bit of cut and paste is still a more professional look that a printed paper shipping label attached with packing tape.
270,"I tend to use post-its to identify where I've gone when I run out away from my desk.  I have a 2 inch pad that I can use, but recently I just rip off a strip and stick it on my cubicle and write directly on it with a sharpie..  Fast.  And since the entire back is adhesive, tends to be more reliable than a small post-it pad on my glossy cube overhanging compartment.Green is a cool color for notes like this... Yellow is too Yellow,  Blue is usually ignored and too dark.. and anything else is too unmanly ...:)"
270,"This pack fo tape includes simple dispensers that make it easy to leave in a drawer where needed, but not as bulky as a professional packing tape dispenser.  The tape is crystal clear and feels like it gives a solid adhesion that you can trust for mailing packages in any temperature climate."
270,"Sticky notes are darn useful and these notes are great for sticking to paper and most surfaces.  They dont stick well to a textured refridgerator door,  but that's really pressing the limit of the restickable adhesive.  The colors are not washed out -- not are they too strong to make writing with a blue or black pen hard to be easily red.400 sheets.. a years worth of notes.. a good deal."
392,"I used this tape over the holidays for all my gift wrapping, and was very pleased with how it performed.First, it really does disappear on most gift wraps -- only on the shiniest foil wrap was I able to see the tape.  It has a subtle satin finish that just blends easily with ... well .. almost everything.  Second, it holds VERY securely.  If you're used to lesser tapes that let you carefully peel and reposition a flap, you'll soon find that this tape behaves differently.  Make sure you have things just where you want them before you stick down the tape.I would consider this a definite ""step up"" from my old stand-by, Scotch Magic Tape.  Definitely outperforms it by a long shot."
392,"These little NoteTabs are just about perfect.  They're sturdy enough to withstand lots of wear, they're small enough to be somewhat inconspicuous, and the colors are nice, too.  I've been using them (along with their more ""square"" cousins) to bookmark sections of books and articles I intend to use in my thesis.  They've also seen a lot of use in the musical folders I use for the two vocal ensembles in which I sing -- to separate and mark different pieces of music so that I can find them quickly during rehearsal.  I just purchased 3 more packages for that purpose.  Reusable, sturdy, big enough to write on -- I don't know how these could be any better."
392,"I don't know why 3M is marketing this as a laptop accessory -- that's one of the LAST places I would use it.  As others have mentioned, if I need to take a note while I'm on my laptop, I use one of the apps on my laptop.However, this little dispenser IS handy for other things.  I serve on the boards of a couple of organizations, and I have one of these attached to the inside cover of the binder I use to store meeting minutes, finance reports, etc.  I use them to mark things I need to review or talk about during the meetings.I also have one of them on the inside of my music folder to use during rehearsals when I want to mark something in my music without writing on my score.  The size allows me enough room to write a more detailed description of what I need to work on, or what I might want to cover during sectional rehearsals.They're very handy, easy to get into place (but follow the directions carefully, or you'll end up with the folder pulling away from the surface whenever you try to remove a note), and they're refillable.My only complaint, really, is that they hold only 20 notes, and the refills are a little more expansive than I think they ought to be."
392,"I think this is a brilliant idea -- I've used post-its for years, and often thought a removable label would be perfect.  These are pretty good, but not quite perfect yet.They stick to glass just fine.  I use them to label the jars of different coffees I have on hand.  I reuse quart jars to hold individual varieties of both ground and whole bean coffees in my pantry.  This allows me to change up my collection and change labels without worrying about leaving sticky residue.  They're colorful, too -- and look nice.Sticking to plastic was a problem.  I found that they stick to some disposable plastic containers (Rubbermaid Take-Alongs, for example), but NOT to the more durable reusable plastic containers.  This will be an issue for a lot of folks, I'm sure.Getting an individual label off the pad can be an issue, too.  Some days I could extract a single label with no problem; other days, it was a struggle.  I'm not sure what the problem was -- humidity, maybe?Anyway, I'll keep using these in my pantry, but I'm not sure I'll use them for anything else."
392,"... for my purposes, anyway.  Here's how I've been using these:1.  Cookbooks -- I collect 'em.  When I get a new one, I like to read through it, marking recipes that catch my interest.  These are PERFECT for that purpose.2.  Marking research materials.  I'm a grad student (non-traditional), in the midst of trying to finish my thesis so I can actually graduate someday.  These have saved me HOURS of work in finding the quotes I need for my writing.  I can ""mark"" my source books and articles, and then retrieve them quickly.3.  I sing in 2 choral groups, and conduct one more.  In one group, we have 24 pieces of music in a binder and we need to be able to find the particular piece during rehearsal very quickly.  These work perfectly.  I can write the name of the piece on the tab, and quickly find what I'm looking for.These are sturdy -- they're much heavier than post-it flags, and the larger size works well for me, too.I've been using post-it flags for years.  No more.  I'll definitely be purchasing these instead."
392,"I recently down-sized, and I have a lot of stuff I ""rotate"" based on the season.  Setting up shelving in my oversized garage wasn't a problem.  Finding good quality storage boxes was.Enter these Fellowes small moving boxes.  They are the perfect size for my Rubbermaid shelvingRubbermaid 7086 72-Inch Five-Shelf Shelving Unit-- the shelves are 18"" deep; the boxes are 16"" deep.  It looks nice to have all the same style of box (OK, so that's not critical to a lot of folks, but I happen to like things to ""match"").The boxes are sturdy enough for my needs, storing everything from books i've used in my classes (I'm a ""non-traditional"" grad student in music) to holiday decorations.  I like the attached ""lid,"" too -- and they're easy to set up.I will probably purchase more of these boxes to finish out my garage storage system.  I think they're worth the price."
392,"I've been using the other popular brand of adhesive flags for years to mark books (especially cookbooks!) for things I want to go back to later.  These work just as well, and are quite a lot cheaper.  I used them to mark books and articles for my thesis (as a grad student in Music History and Literature), to mark music for the groups I sing with and conduct, to highlight items for meetings I lead as chair of the board of trustees at my church.  They're sturdy, and easy to apply and remove."
392,"I used this over the holidays to seal boxes I was sending via UPS  It really is an improvement over the older clunky packing tape dispensers: ergonomic grip, tape doesn't get lost, etc.  It's easy to use, comfortable, etc.It probably wouldn't be a great choice for anyone who has to ship a LOT of stuff.  The replacement tape isn't the ""standard"" packing tape size: the roll has a smaller diameter core, and the tape is narrower.  It's also quite a bit more expensive than standard shipping tape.But for casual home use, this really works nicely."
392,"OK, I'll admit it: I'm an office products junky.  I'm always looking for that perfect black fine-point pen, or just the right file folders.  I've probably sampled just about every permutation of repositionable labels available in my search for the perfect stick-on tab for research materials (for my interminable thesis) and music.These new Post-it Durable Tabs are very good.  The colors allow me to color code references I need to be able to locate quickly (red for historical dates/etc., green for social customs, blue for religious connections, etc.).  I also use them as quick index markers for music in a couple of choral groups.  In one group, we usually sing 20-30 pieces for a concert, and I need to be able to locate the next piece we're working on during rehearsal.The extra space under the white tab allows me to make a few notes, too -- which I can then erase if I reuse the tabs.This aren't quite as substantial as the Avery labels of similar size -- the plastic is thinner in these Post-its -- but it's certainly sufficient to make these durable enough for most uses."
392,"Depending on your need, this could be the perfect solution.  The tabs are super sturdy -- a heavy-ish plastic, lightly colored, but still transparent.  There is a LOT of writing space with these, so they would be more suited to situations where you want to write some notes on the tab.I tried these with ball-point, gel writer, fine-point permanent marker, and pencil.  All worked well, but I found pencil to be the most useful -- you can erase your notes, and reuse the tab elsewhere.I've been using mine to mark sections of my home-owners association CC&Rs; and by-laws -- I was just appointed treasurer and I need to make sure I can find the legalities quickly, and make my own notes where needed.  These are study enough that I can use them to ""flip"" to the desired page without worrying about tearing the page.If you're looking for something just to mark pages, these might be overkill (Avery has some other smaller tabs that would probably work better).  But for those situations where you need to make some more extensive notes, these might be just right."
392,"I make a lot of hand-made greeting cards, and I use a LOT of roll-on adhesive to affix background papers to card blanks.  Most of the oens I use (including other Scotch brand ""tape pens"") are NOT refillable.  This one is, though, and that's definitely a plus.It works beautifully for my purposes.  You get 49' of adhesive, compared to just over 26 feet in my ""usual"" adhesive.  And the price is about the same (this is about fifty cents more than my usual).  Refills are available here on Amazon, so this works out great.I'm planning to start using this regularly."
392,"... and with 2000 in the package, I'll never have to order from those expensive label companies again.I like being able to print off a page of these just when I need them.  So far, I've used them for my own personal address labels, and also for my condo homeowners association return address labels (I'm the treasurer, so I have to pay bills and mail checks ... ).  I've printed them using an HP all-in-one printer and they work just fine.I really like the ""quick lift"" feature -- no more struggling to free a corner of the label from the adhesive!  Just slightly bend the backing, and the edge pops loose, making it easy to get the label off the backing.  These are good, better than I expected."
392,"These couldn't have arrived at a better time: I'm the treasurer for my condo association, and I was just in the process of setting up my files for this year.  This gave me a great opportunity to try them out on a real application.Overall, I'm very happy with these.  They are definitely heavier/sturdier than the ""usual"" manila folders you can pick up at your local office supply.  This is a good thing, since I'm in and out of my records several times a week.The ""supertab"" bit is a little over-promoted, I think.  Smead achieves the larger writing space by cutting down the ""front cover"" of the folder, thereby exposing more of the inside of the ""back cover.""  Yes, there's a large space in which to write, but it will be covered by any standard sized (8.5"" x 11"") papers you put in the folder.OVerall, these are excellent heavy-duty folders; just don't expect too much from the ""SuperTab"" feature."
591,"Oh darn. I wanted to love this. I thought this was the one I purchased before. But this does not do well for 2-sided printing. It's so thin that the one side shows through the other. So that kind of defeats the brightness factor! If you just want cheap paper that prints fine on one side, this one will work, but if you want something that looks quality, you'll want to spend more for better."
591,"5 stars because of overall performance and qualitiesPROS:Durable stitched-style seams.Clear view covers resist toner (see cons of this below)Hinge is extra-durableHinge can be opened with one finger triggerDouble pockets (taller and shorter) on each inner side.5-year satisfaction guaranteeCONSView covers a little ""textured""--typical of non-glare surfaces. Not crystal clear.Round rings versus popular D-ring. However, it is secured to the side, as D rings are set, so it shouldn't be a problem.(Like D-rings, the papers will put pressure on the side of the clip versus the to the spot where both sides meet. This prevents papers from falling out too easily when the rings open slightly)"
591,"I am always trying to find better ways to take notes. These are not only tabs, but you can write notes on them. I put them on key places in my textbooks as tabs, and then use the surface to write extra tips. they are clear, so you don't have to worry about them covering up anything. They're a little sturdier than regular post-its...like tabs should be. They look cool, too.  I want to get them in the other colors, now. The adhesive is on every part except the tab and it's good repositionable adhesive.They would be GREAT for talks/speeches where you open up a book to quote from it and you could write an extra little note on the surface.Highly recommend!"
591,"These are quite pretty--Translucent. So you can see below them if you cover it up a bit. You can write on them--just let the ink dry before touching them. This version is a little wider than I normally want. They stick well, and apparently can become permanent with time.I use them to mark important pages in my textbooks. I am loving all these new post-it products!"
591,"This is going to make me more confident in adding labels to my files, my notebooks...pretty much anything! I don't have to worry that I may change my mind later.And I can easily print them using MS Word (I downloaded a free template off the post-it site).I feel like these are a genius invention--almost as genius as the original post-it. And if you haven't tried the pop-up post-it holder, you need to. It's a post-it lovers dream!"
591,"I hope everyone who wants an effective labeling program will contact Avery to complain about the program so they can fix the glitches in it. Meanwhile, it's easy to make a basic template in MS Publisher and decorate the tickets how I want. The problem is in the numbering, which is difficult without the program, so you'll have to do some legwork if you need the ticket and stub to have matching unique numbers. But if you don't need that aspect then I love that Avery gives us the option to use these tickets with our home printer. It's so slick for school programs and other smaller activities where having tickets printed is not cost-effective. It will seem so classy to have tear off tickets! The thickness of the ticket could be a little thicker, but being a little thinner than standard tickets does make them a little easier to print. Overall, the quality of the tickets and printability is 4 stars."
591,"Having suffered with many inferior binders, I was glad for the opportunity to test out this Wilson Jones version. With so many NON-durable binders touting their &#34;Heavy Duty&#34; titles, I tend to skeptical. You get what you pay for with binders, so if you're going to spent more than $6 on a 2-inch binder, you're hoping it will last. And I have to say, you won't be disappointed with this.It's solid, without being heavy. The D-rings glide easily open and closed and are constructed to not wear down within a short period which could cause the clips to let papers slide out. (Once a binder's rings get warped you may as well toss it to save the annoyance).There are clear sleeves allowing you to insert decorations/instructions/etc  on the front, spine and back, which is almost expected anymore. I will say that the clear sleeves are not as thick as some binders and to my dissappointment, the back sleeve is bolted down. The bolts make the D-ring bolted within the binder, but this means you can only use the portion to the left of the bolts or grab an exacto blade and gently cut the sleeve from the &#34;bolts&#34;. By doing that you can fill the entire back with a paper insert, but you run the risk of ugly cut marks. I did this with a similar binder recently and ended up adding stickers over my poor cut-jobOne cool feature is that the inner pockets are double pockets. So you can put smaller items in the front and the full page sized docs behind them in a separate sleeve/pocket.All in all, this will well outlast its $3 cousins and save you from the frustration when that cheap version quickly flattens into an annoying and ugly waste of money.I'm shaving off a star for:1. Somewhat thin sleeve material2. Back sleeve bolted down (some binders have a hold punched in the sleeve material at that location in order for people to fill the entire back sleeve.3. It's not exactly beautiful. They have a funky angled stitching on the seams, which looks very sturdy but also looks a bit utilitarian.  But once I put some snazzy scrapbook paper inserts in the outer sleeves, no one will notice the &#34;sensible&#34; sleeves.Feel free to ask questions below. Thanks for any positive feedback!"
591,"I don't have a laptop. I put these on my school and other binders. I often need post-its when I'm away at meetings or at school with binders in hand. They feel a little flimsy...like they may come apart, so I only gave them four stars, but I will update later. The material they are made of is NOT paper. It's a thin plastic. So that aspect assures me they might stay together for a long time.They could definitely use instructions, but it's not rocket science. You put the post-its in, fold in the sides, then the top and bottom..remove adhesive. Stick to something. To change them out, make sure there are no post-its ""popping out."" Carefully flip out the side, remove the previous post-its and replace. They cannot hold an entire normal sized pad, so you'd want to use, say, 1/3 of a normal pad when you replace them.But overall, this is just another ingenious product from post-it. They are truly a wonderful product and it's too bad my local stores don't carry more of their innovative products. The pack comes with all 3 colors (green, hot pink, black). And I am definitely glad to get them. For the amount of convenience and use these will get, they are a total bargain!UPDATE: After using this for months, I have to say, I still love it! So great to have post-its right in my binder for when I need them."
591,"If you haven't tried pop-up post-its you are missing out. Seriously! Instead of little pads that always end up all over the house, pop-up post-its stay in one place and are always fresh and clean (no gunk on the back adhesive, no wear on the edges). Take out one and another pops right up. Magic!So here I ordered this pop up dispenser which is cheaper than the desk kind and doesn't use up any desk space. And the pen holder is right there in hopes people would leave the pen there for when you need it. A way to tie the pen to the holder might be a good upgrade. You could also use the holder for the post-it flag pens, which are cool for quick and accurate little ""bookmarks.""It's actually more attractive than the desk holder, and can be adhered to walls or the refrigerator...the chalkboard. In a public place, you may go too quickly through them.As a fan of the post-it, I'm so glad I finally got a pop-up holder and this wall version is more compact and convenient. It uses command adhesive which should be easily removable. Thumbs way up!"
591,"So nice to have these labels that I can put on my food storage and other storage boxes or notebooks and not worry about them leaving a sticky residue if I want to remove them later.Each label has a little tab to make it easy to apply. You could even leave them on for easier removal as well. These are bright and easy to see!And sooo removable! I have tried making my regular labels more removable by putting tissue in the center behind the label, but it's just not as good.So thanks to 3M, I can stick and remove all I want!"
591,"Those people at 3M must sit around all day thinking up what people could use with post-it adhesive. And this is another product that I easily find uses for. I have the post-it labels..but they are limited in length. This one can be as long as you want it. You could even use it for decorating things temporarily or as a stencil line for a dryer kind of paint. As far as a negative, it's not going to have the crisp cut edge of the post-it removable labels, but if you're picky you could get out the scissors to get a crisper cut. You use it like you would making labels with masking tape, but it's more attractive and easier to write on than masking tape and no residue when you remove it. Thumbs up!"
395,"These pads have two strips of adhesive, so they stay put much better than others sticky notes.  The adhesive is at the top, like normal, and about half way between the bottom and the adhesive along the top.  The paper colors are nice too."
395,3M Scotch tape is the best.  It is an essential office supply that is great for all of your regular tape needs.  It is a very high quality product and isn't going to disappoint you.  The only thing that could be improved is the size of the roll; it is a little on the small side and I wish there was more included.
395,"This is a very cool product.  It rolls small dots of glue down on a surface.  It will work for a lot of things but isn't industrial strength so it does have limits.  But then again, for some things, you probably don't want a glue that sticks things together too strongly.  This dot roller is a very inventive office product and it wouldn't hurt to own one for your desk."
395,This is one of those products that you need to have in your home to fix odds and ends. 3M makes the best adhesive products and will not disappoint you. This glue works great and is worth getting...
395,"Of the 3M line of labels, these have to be my favorite.  They are a nice cute size --your typical small size return address label.  3M makes high quality adhesive products so you will not be disappointed with them.  Considering there are 2000 labels in this package, you should be all set for a while with this one."
395,"Besides the obvious use for these, I also have found they work great for making return address labels because they are thinner/smaller, which works perfect for that.  3M makes great products so this one is a good choice."
395,"These shipping labels have the high quality you expect from 3M.  The 2"" X 4"" size should fit your needs for packages or address that need a lot of space.  They are also large enough to use for name badges.  For me the most important thing is ""will they stick?"" and you can rest easy, your satisfaction is guaranteed.  These 3M labels are great and made in the USA."
395,"This is a really cool tape dispenser.  When placed on a smooth surface, it sticks to it and will not come off easier (but move it to the edge of the surface and it comes right off).  The tape is just the right size too - not too small or big.  This is a very inventive product and great for any desk."
395,"Scotch tape is great the way it is on the traditional dispenser, but I have to say this is a great set of dispensers and extra tapes.  These dispensers work great and are very convenient.  This package comes with a lot so you're probably going to be pleasantly surprised with how nice this set is."
395,"Although the box makes no claims of having special tamper features, the description does.  As others have pointed out, they are simply not true (as I have personally tested also).These are pretty normal envelopes and don't expect anything beyond that.  They have a self-adhesive strip that probably can be undone without too much notice so don't believe the product description.  But with that said, these are pretty nice envelopes!  The self adhesive is easy to use and they have a nice print on the inside that would make it a little more difficult to see what is in the envelope."
395,"These are the size address labels I use most often and have enough room for most addresses.  3M makes quality products so rest assured this is a good choice.  I would be hesitant in using any another product, as these are perfect!"
1811,"This is a really simple adjustment to a standard post-it style sticky note. A thin belt of glue in the middle of the note that helps to keep it flat against a surface - but takes away some of the ability to write on the back of the note.  A specialized item, no doubt, but I have found the sticky note stick'em is just not as strong as the Post-It note glue.  If you really need a flat stick, its better than nothing, but the poor lasting power of the note removes the benefits of the added strip to keep the note flat."
1811,"Not much to sayabout this product. It is a tab that you can see through. It seems you can move it too, without lifting the ink of whatever you covered it with, but how many resuses you can get seems limited. Think of it as a see through post it note with a tab on the end. But it is a little thick and could be a problem when using more than a few of them in, oh, say, a text book. Not bad, not great. Just another tool of limited use. The price point will be the issue on this one! I doubt I would ever pay for this unless it was super cheap."
1811,"I really like this packaging tape dispenser!  The handle is superiorly sized to get a nice grip to set an angle to quickly close a box. The covered top reduced the opportunity for tape to flip back on itself or grab an area you didn't want the sticky side to touch.  This design is aesthetically pleasing. I didn't expect much out of this product, other than a way to get you to pay for something extra you don't really need for the job, but have found the extras on this device to be really job enhancing. Great product!"
1811,"I work with project managers who have to keep an office in a trailer that moves a lot, filing and mainting files important to the project and in the process of getting people paid for their labor.  I passed along these tabs to my team, and the reviews I got back were very positive. They are bright colored, easy to use, and tough. And when it's time to change from one project to another, they are easy to swap out. Worthy for paper files that change fairly frequently, but need to be durable when in use."
1811,"Labels are labels. 3M has always made clean and easy to read true white lables. The adhesive value is strong, and one expects from 3M, so in the end it comes down to a simple measure; How well does the software dowloaded from the 3M site allow you to optimize the products potential?  Well, the templates for the File Folder labels are simple, easy to use and understand, and create clean, non-smeared, prints.  Pretty happy.  Most of the time these speciality products for office use fail to be worth the price they ask for them. It is not that they fail to perform their functions, but that the function performed is easily replicated for a cheaper cost. 3M's File Folder Labels, however, are competitively priced.  The only caveat: These must be used in a laser printer. Ink Jets will have less than desirable results. So, if you have a laser printer, use this product for your file labels!"
1811,"For over a year I have had to deal with a dry-erase marker 120 day planner on the office wall.  It is one of those things that has four blank months on it and you fill in the dates and names and every month you have to erase the old accumulated data and fill in the month due up four months down the line.  It is a great ""at-a-glance"" tool, until it is time to erase the month.  Colored dry-erase pens seems to really hang on, even the traditional black can require scrubbing and rubbing with traditional white board erasers.  I always blamed it on the fact that even though the laminated calendar is designed for dry-erase pens, it is not actually a white board. I have tried many kinds of erasers and sprays to help this process and - well, it is a elbow-grease pain in the tukas. When I tested the 3M Whiteboard Eraser I wasn't expecting much. Did a great job on the regular old white board, but so did the standard eraser, The Foray circular eraser with cleaner head underneath, and the Expo white board spray, and none of these helped a lick with that month-at-a-glance on the old wall.  So, I gave it a quick swipe and - WOW - it took off the four month old stuff, the new stuff, the colored stuff, with such ease.  Shocked, actually, that it does such a great job with such little effort.  Can't recommend this highly enough.It claims to work on permanent marker if you add a little water -- I did not test this -- but I also don't care if it can. It is already a big winner with me.  Buy and try it."
1811,"I found it too much of a pain to get a good template going for this product. The design time is supposed to be increased and the tech work lessened with avery products, but in this case it is the other way around. Couldn't you just have a template with clear bordering lines available?  But, the final result is really good! so, the good balances the bad - and there is always hope avery will put out a reliable template and not some internet based BS."
1811,"These are nice chisel tipped dry erase markers.  They dry fast, have vivid colors, and - most important for the colors - wipe away easily even after being left on the board for a few days.  Color dry erase pens tend to leave &#34;echos&#34; that are hard to get off the board if they sit too long. So far, these are passing the wipe away test with ease. Very happy with them."
1811,"It's a white security envelope with a seal - no licking required - what can more you really say about it? The blue security print is fine, the seal strip is a bit thinner than most competetors, but it had a solid grip on the flap. I sealed an envelope up and then broke the seal to see the promoted red ""opened"" mark so I would know it was tampered with, but there was no such marking -- which was the concept that sperated this one from others.  It will do the job just fine, otherwise."
1811,"It's hard to dislike these functional label pads that combine the features of a post-it note with a box lable.  It is easy to use, easy to see, and does the job. If you are in a business where you have a lot of temporary boxes or files that need a nice sized lable, use these. But, in all honesty, you have to have a real need to justify the price. It is cheaper to use a sharpie and a roll of tape if you don't really require the bright color the pads bring.  All said, great product I will probably never buy because of the price point. If it's in your budget, however, induldge!"
1811,"Most of the special items in the tape, sticky, and label world are really cool and really pricey making them items too expensive to be worth buying.  Not this wrist tape dispenser.  The reloads are cheap, it works as advertised, and it makes big projects easier. All this with a decent starting price. No complaints on this one! Buy and enjoy."
1811,"This roll of post it sticky note paper works like a roll of scotch tape.  You roll out a strip of low tack sticky paper and write what you want on it, pull to remove (like any post-it note).  It is simple, strong, and very basic.  Not much to complain about here except the price."
434,The Avery labels are a useful pad of sticky labels for multiple uses.  The solid pastel colors look nice and they peel from the pad easily and stick onto various surfaces.  I find them especially useful for labeling boxes I have stored in my closet so I remember what I put inside them.  It even sticks to clothing fairly well.  The tabs have perforations so they can be removed once you peel the label from the pad.  The only small downside is that they sort of peel off too easily once you stick them onto something.  Hopefully they don't just come off by themselves.  I have had that problem when buying generic Post-It notes.
434,"I am a big fan of labels and have a big stack of them for various uses (CD's, jewel cases, floppy disks, addresses, etc.) as well as a handheld P-touch labeler. The 3M Permanent Adhesive file folder labels add another useful label to my collection.The file folder labels are a really good value. You get 750 labels, which comes out to just under $0.02 per label. You have the option of using a number of applications to print them on inkjet or laser printers. I have Office XP and normally use Word to print sheets of identical labels. For these labels, you can use the Avery 5366 template in Word. When you need different labels on a sheet, you can just download template 3300-H from 3M's website. In a pinch, you always have the option of writing on the labels by hand too. They stick very well and do not smudge.My only complaint about these labels are their dimensions. It might have been nice to mix in some smaller sizes as well. Since most of my file labels are 1 or 2 words, I'd have to use a 16 or 18pt font just to fill out the entire label without leaving too much white space. If you need removable labels, 3M's Post-it brand sells theidentical labels in removable form. I own both of them and they use the same templates.The 3M Permanent Adhesive labels do just what they were intended to do. They are of good quality, very versatile in the number of uses other than just files, and are a great value. I recommend them."
434,"The 3M Permanent Adhesive Shipping Labels stick very well so align them correctly the first time!  They are very useful for printing out those shipping labels for your customers or sending out those gifts to your family.  I know my handwriting has gotten atrocious over the years so it's nice to be able to print them out.There are quite a few labels in the pack for the money.  25 sheets of 10 labels each for a total of 250.  They are compatible with the Avery 5163 template so you can choose to use Microsoft Word for identical templates or the 3100-S Word template from 3M's website for individual addresses.They are marketed as laser compatible but I had no problems using them with my HP inkjet.  They do bleed every so slightly however, but nothing anyone will really notice."
434,"These Scotch dispensers are a fantastic idea and are very convenient.  The handband dispenser is perfect for gift wrapping and I might even wrap some presents myself this year instead of letting my wife do them all!  Each pad of tape consists of 75 2"" pre-cut tape.  The only negative thing I have to say about the handband dispenser is that it is initially pretty difficult to open.  After a few removals however, it loosened up a bit and got easier to load the tape packs in.The deskgrip dispensers are much easier to load and contain 2 packs of tape per dispenser.  The rubber base sticks to my desk and moves around easily.  This one is perfect for my kids to use without (hopefully) wasting tape.  Great for projects and crafts.  My kids tend to peel out about a foot of tape from regular dispensers when trying to get about an inch or two and they get all mangled.This value pack consists of 2 dispensers of each type and 10 total packs of tape.  Each of the deskgrip dispensers already come with 2 packs of tape inserted in each.  The handband dispensers need to be filled before use.  The refill pads are a good deal on Amazon.  You can get a 12 pack ofScotch Pop-Up Tape Stripsfor just $8."
434,"Though the Post-it Removable Color Coding Labels are marked as Laser compatible, it works fine in my multifunction inkjet printer without jamming.  It comes with 15 sheets total with 30 labels per sheet.  3 sheets of blue and 4 sheets of pink, yellow, and limeade.  I have to be honest though, I don't particularly like any of the colors.  I would've preferred normal primary colors or even pastels for a more professional look.The dimensions (1"" x 2 5/8"") are exactly the same as the Avery 5160 address labels so Microsoft Word and other apps/templates will easily work with them.  If all else fails, you can download a Word template from Post-it's website.The labels stick and remove easily and look good printed.  On my inkjet however, the text does tend to bleed just a tad, but still looks sharp enough for general use.  The 2700-P labels from Post-it are useful labels that work well but I hope they offer more colors at some point."
434,"I have been using Avery 5160 or compatible labels for years. The 3M Permanent Address Labels work as well as any that I have used. I use Microsoft Word to print entire sheets of addresses. 3M's Word template for the 3100-A can be used should you need to put different addresses on each label.Though the labels are recommended for laser printers, it went through my HP AIO inkjet printer just fine without jamming or the labels peeling. The ink dried fairly quickly and have no smudges. At a cost of about $0.01 per label ($0.29 per sheet), they are a nice value. The only thing I really like better about them than say the Avery brand ones, is that the actual label seems to be more of a true bright white, whereas the Avery's appear a bit more of an off-white to me. I'll probably just do a quick price check before reordering and end up buying the least expensive ones at that time.A great value and easy printing make the 3M permanent address labels a good buy. I recommend them."
434,"I have previously used moving boxes from the likes of Uhaul and Bekins, which were pretty much the same.  I thought at the time that they were the perfect moving boxes, but these Fellowes boxes are even better.The boxes are very simple to put together and only take about 10 seconds each.  They are sturdier than other moving boxes I have used and are much better for stacking.  Not having to use tape is a bonus and there is plenty of writing area to designate the contents.When not in use, they are easy to disassemble and store flat.  I use a couple of them to store knickknacks and holiday decorations.  I would recommend these for anyone looking for a good quality moving box.  I personally still prefer to go to retail stores and ask for their discarded boxes or going on Craigslist and getting recycled boxes rather than buying new boxes.  Greener and cheaper."
434,"The 3M Gel Wrist Rest (WR340LE) is an outstanding wrist rest.  The leatherette, anti-microbial cover is very comfortable.  The gel is firmer than others I've used but no less comfortable.  The firm gel seems more durable than the others too.  Other gel wrist rests I've used became malformed after a short period of use.  Also, because of the firmness, it keep my wrists from sagging and maintains a more ergonomic, neutral position.I highly recommend this series of gel wrist rests by 3M."
434,"Mechanical pencils are among the many things that I used to collect as a young adult.  As a younger man, I preferred very sharp, thin lines.  As I grew older, I leaned more towards 0.7mm lead because of how easily the 0.5mm lead would break.  When I was offered the Uni-ball KuruToga Twist and Turn mechanical pencil, I was skeptical about the strength of the lead but was eager to try it out.Like my favorite Uni-ball pens, the KuruToga mechanical pencil feels solid in my hands.  The clip on the pencil is plastic but I usually prefer metal clips.  Still, the overall feel of the pencil is good and the rubber ring around the tip is very good for keeping a solid grip.  The eraser is extremely small and the cap is a bit hard to remove.  You'll want to keep a more substantial eraser around for long writing or drawing sessions.The Twist and Turn feature seems to actually work.  I did not find myself twisting the lead over to find the sharpest edge while writing and drawing.  I also used enough force to try and break the lead and to my surprise, it did not!  Lead breakage was just a fact of life for me when using mechanical pencils so the strength of the Uni-ball 0.5mm lead is impressive.Though there are nicer mechanical pencils, the Uni-ball KuruToga starter set is a very good value.  It comes with extra lead and 2 extra erasers for very reasonable cost.  TheUni-ball Diamond Infused Leadsare available from Amazon as well and are a great price.  I recommend both without reservations."
434,"The Scotch Adhesive Dot Roller claims to be precise, smooth and neat, as compared to traditional glue.  While this may be the case in some instances, it's not necessarily better than glue or glue sticks.The applicator is very easy and convenient to use.  Also, paper looked nicer when adhered using the Dot Roller.  With glue, you tend to get spots where it is obvious where the glue was used.  Glue sticks can also reveal spots where no or not enough glue was used.  But with these conveniences, come some drawbacks.I found that the adhesive wasn't strong enough to stay stuck on paper projects.  They peeled rather easily.  For one-time office presentations, I think the Scotch Adhesive Dot Roller would do the job quite nicely and easily.  However, for kid projects where you want it to last longer and be more durable, I would ""stick"" to the tried and true Elmer's glue or glue sticks.I also think that for household use and children's projects, the Dot Roller is just not economical.  You can buy a6-pack of glue sticksfor less than a single applicator of the Dot Roller.  The refill costs as much as the 6-pack of glue sticks on Amazon.com.The Scotch Adhesive Dot Roller is a neat idea and has it's applications, mostly for office presentations.  I think most of us with household and kid's projects however, will be just as happy sticking with good 'ole glue sticks while saving a few bucks."
434,"There are a lot of choices when it comes to super glues.  I've used several different brands and types over the years but the Scotch Super Glue is probably the only I'll remember to get again.The formula for most super glues doesn't seem to change much from brand to brand, so the differentiator is really the applicator.  The applicator on the Scotch brand is precise and easy to use, but the real appeal is the clog-resistant bottle.  In the past, I've only needed super glue maybe once or twice a year, so getting the glue flowing again was always a pain because the tip would dry out--not so with the Scotch.The first time I used it was when my daughter broke a figurine that she'd gotten just the day before.  I applied the Scotch easily and let it dry overnight.  It bonded so well that I let her take the figurine to school a few days later for sharing.  A few weeks later, my daughter (notice a theme here?) broke a couple of cups from her ceramic play tea set.  When I went to use the Scotch Super Glue, the glue flowed out as well as the first time.The Scotch Super Glue liquid is reasonably priced, bonds well to the supported materials, and is easy to apply.  That's pretty much all you can ask for in a super glue.  I recommend it."
434,"I am a big fan of labels and have a big stack of them for various uses (CD's, jewel cases, floppy disks, addresses, etc.) as well as a handheld P-touch labeler.  The one thing that none of my previous labels could do is be removed cleanly.  The Post-it Super Sticky Removable labels kick it up a notch by allowing you to remove them from file folders as well as other items.First of all, what a value.  You get 750 labels, which comes out to $0.02 per label.  You have the option of using a number of applications to print them on inkjet or laser printers.  I have Office XP and normally use Word to print sheets of identical labels.  For these labels, you can use the Avery 5366 template in Word.  When you need different labels on a sheet, you can just download template 2100-H from Post-it's website.  I used the template to print about 5 labels for some of my file folders and even included some icons/logos and they came out great.  In a pinch, you always have the option of writing on the labels by hand too.  They stick quite well and amazingly, remove fairly easily.  I tried to remove a previous label from one of my file folders and waddya know, I couldn't remove it cleanly and left a mess.My only complaint about these labels are their dimensions.  It might have been nice to mix in some smaller sizes as well.  Since most of my file labels are 1 or 2 words, I'd have to use a 16 or 18pt font just to fill out the entire label without leaving too much white space.  If you need permanent labess, Post-it's parent company, 3M, sells theidentical labels in permanent form.  I own both of them and they use the same templates.The Post-it Super Sticky labels do just what they were intended to do.  They are of good quality, very versatile in the number of uses other than just files, and are a great value.  I recommend them for the highly organized and super detailed."
434,"Not a single review of the 3M Permanent Return Address Labels are a Verified Purchase or non-Vine Review.  Nothing wrong with that.  I just think it's funny.  I wonder if anyone's even purchased these since they've become available for purchase...Oh, yeah, the labels are cool.  They work with my inkjet printer fine and they peel very easily from the backing.  Keep in mind that they are small and thin like the complimentary address labels you get in the mail from charities.  Good for return address labeling but not as good for shipping labels.  3M and their Avery brand are really pushing to take a piece of the label pie from Avery and they seem to be doing a great job.  I'm happy with all their labels.  You will be too.Happy labeling everyone :)"
434,"I buy a box of self adhesive #10 envelopes about once a year.  I rarely have to use USPS but when I do, I dislike having to mess with licking glue and prefer some level of safety so that the contents are not easily visible.  The Quality Park Reveal-N-Seal offered to solve the only real annoying aspect of self-adhesive envelopes-- the peel strips.ADHESIVEThe adhesive was easy to reveal and I pressed firmly across the adhesive line a few times.  No messy peel strips to dispose of!  After waiting only a few minutes, I tried to slowly open the flap without tearing it.  No go.  It tore in 5 separate spots before I could get the whole flap opened.  The adhesive worked so quickly and so well, that in less than 5 minutes, you couldn't reopen the envelope without ripping.  In my opinion, it worked as advertised.SECURITYTo my disappointment, I could make out the contents of the envelope by shining a bright light through it.  It wasn't easy, but it wouldn't take someone too long to read what was inside.  To compare, I tested my old generic office supply store envelopes and the Quality Park envelopes did outperform them in that regard.  So while it was more secure than generic safety envelopes, it wasn't completely secure.  I'm used to ""wrapping"" whatever I send with a sheet of copy/printer paper anyways, which pretty much makes it impossible to read through.  Also, I have no idea what the other reviewers are talking about with the red letters.  My box of envelopes do not mention anything of the like.SUMMARYMost 40 count safety #10 envelopes cost about as much as the Quality Park Reveal-N-Seal envelopes.  I don't know of a particular brand that is completely safe so maybe these are as good as they get.  Regardless, they are definitely better than the office supply store branded ones I use and they are more convenient.  As long as they continue to make them when I need more, I plan on buying them for future use."
434,"I ordered the Post-It Pop-up Notes Dispenser to use in the kitchen, where my family and I often come up with our best ""bright"" ideas.  I was thinking it'd be perfect for the fridge.  While the locking adhesive strips work well, I would've preferred a magnet for the refrigerator.  I use similar 3M strips to hang picture frames and they are strong but my fridge needs constant rearranging with new magnets, photos, and kid's art work.The pen holder on it is just ok, but really could've benefited by being deeper.  The pop-up style Post-It notes peel out easily but you have to peel them from the dispenser first before writing on them.  The dispenser is offered in green, blue, and pink but where is the ubiquitous yellow?The convenience yielded by this product is sure to be minimal for most.  But if it happens to fit your needs, at least it's a pretty fair price."
434,"I've only ever bought or used two brands of sticky notes, to my recollection--3M and Highland.  I bought the cheaper Highland brand from an office supply store thinking that a sticky note is a sticky note, but I was wrong.  The Highland brand's adhesive was very poor and wouldn't stay stuck for very long, so I ""stuck"" with the 3M Post-it notes for yearsAvery Sticky Notes are adequate and work well, but aren't quite quite as good as 3M Post-it notes.  They stick well to most smooth, flat surfaces, though not as well on porous or textured surfaces.  I compared a sheet of the Post-it to the Avery and noticed that the Avery sheets are thinner and curl where you peel the sheet from the stack.  The adhesive on 3M Post-it notes are also superior.  My kids really like the assorted colors but I'm partial to the ubiquitous yellow sticky notes.  If you want to save a few bucks, give Avery Sticky Notes a try.  However, for the best quality paper and adhesive, stick with 3M Post-it notes."
599,"GP Spectrum Multi-Use Paper, 8.5 x 11 Inches, 3-Ream Pack (1500 Sheets) is a good paper and a fair price. Great with Amazon Prime Shipping, I highly recommend."
599,"You can't go wrong with SCOTCH tape. It's dependable and useful for thousands of tasks. My only criticism is about the plastic holder, which feels a bit flimsy to me. For around $4.00 for three rolls, it still beats the crappy dollar store tape. I recommend this product."
599,"Bright white, super sticky, and gets the job done. They're also great for organizing jars or anything you may need them for. They are also less expensive than AVERY brand, so check them out."
599,"I used this product to mount photos and artwork and like the outcome. Better than tape, spray adhesives and glue sticks. Worth the price and is a great product overall. I haven't had to reuse them yet, so I can't vouch for that aspect."
599,"I like the feel of these 3M shipping labels. They're just as good as the Avery brand, which presently dominates the market. They work with both laser and inkjet printers. They are a high quality product. The adhesive is terrific and sticks to every type of envelope. They peel easily and I'm glad that this product is made in the USA. This superior product is about three dollars cheaper than Avery, so no need to pay for a label."
599,"I like the feel of these 3M shipping labels. They're just as good as the Avery brand, which presently dominates the market. They work with both laser and  inkjet printers. They are a high quality product. The adhesive is terrific and sticks to every type of envelope. They peel easily and can be used with Microsoft software template 5163. I LOVE that this product is made in the USA. This superior product is also less expensive than Avery labels so there's not need to pay three plus dollars more for Avery shipping labels. I highly recommend you give them a try."
599,"I like these removable sticky labels. The colors are vivid BLUE, GREEN, PINK & YELLOW. They are handy for organizing folders, boxes, jars, or anything you could imagine. The labels can be used an average of five times before they don't stick as well. I recommend them."
599,"I like these Park Reveal-n-Seal envelopes. They do what they say they will. I like the fact I don't need to moisten glue or throw away a piece of paper. Overall, a good deal and worth a try."
599,"POST-it Pop-up Note with dispenser is poorly engineered. Every time I went to pull one out, I'd get two or three and sometimes more. Not worth the aggravation."
599,"I love the colors and use them to organize every from spices, files as well as boxed items. I gave some to a teacher friend, who used them to organize her first-grade class book collection. Only four stars because I feel they're a bit pricey for only 100."
599,I love these colorful Avery Page Markers. The bright hues make them easy to spot. They are also a great for file folders. Highly recommended.
599,This is great shipping tape at a great price. It's heavyweight and easy to use. I like the fact that the tape does not stick back on itself like a lot of other brands. I highly recommend this tape.
677,"These little tabs are decent--they're very durable and they come in many different colors. The only thing I have against them is that the tab part that you can write on is a little small. I've bought the Post-It note version of these things before, and they give you plenty of space to write on. These Avery tabs are still a good product, though!"
677,"I didn't buy these labels with the intent to actually use my printer on them, but rather, to hand-write on them. I've started to re-use folders a lot, and I decided that instead of being annoyed by whiting out the previous handwritten label, I'll just use an adhesive label instead. They work great and suit my needs perfeclty. Like usual, 3M is a great product. If you choose to print your labels, the directions tell you exactly what template to use and whatever else you need to know to print on them. Great product!"
677,"Can you save the money and just tear tape off a dispenser? Yes. Easily. But if you are looking for a product that makes wrapping presents and things easier, it's a convenient product. It's so easy to put the dispenser on your fingers or use the table-top dispenser and end up with perfectly sized pieces every time. Overall, the quantity of items you get in the package is great- you get 2 wrist and 2 table-top dispensers, and lots of refills. I have a feeling they're going to last me for awhile!"
677,"These Post-It dispensers are not really anything special. They're just a cheap-feeling plastic-like material that you put your Post-Its in, and then you can use the adhesive to put the dispenser anywhere you want. It would be a nice stocking stuffer type gift, but I really don't think it's necessary- you can just pull the back page off any Post-It note pack and stick the pack to the wall without having to pay for a dispenser.Cute idea, but not really worth paying for unless you need a little gift for someone."
677,"These Post-It label pads are really nice. I wasn't really sure what they were at first (I got them for free through Amazon Vine), but now I realize all the uses that they have. They are basically heavy-duty Post-It notes that are good for labeling binders, as nametags, or really anything else that you need them for. They can easily be used as regular Post-It notes, but the whole note is sticky instead of having a small sticky portion (there is a non-sticky part so you can peel them away from each other, and then you tear that non-sticky part off). They are also a little thicker than regular Post-Its, and as such, I'm assuming a little more expensive. So, if you're looking to label things, these are a good way to go...if you want something to write notes on, I would stick (haha) with your normal, good-'ol Post-It note."
677,"I admit it; I am a Post-It note freak and I also love to label things. Unfortunately, regular Post-Its (unless you buy the super sticky or the ones that are sticky across the whole paper) don't always like to stick to things such as rubbermaid tubs for an extended period of time. This tape is awesome because it is fully sticky (as opposed to a small band of adhesive), you can tear it to the size you need, and it is easy to remove if you need to change the label you created.In addition, I am a science teacher and sometimes I have the kids rotate around stations in the lab part of my room. I love using tape like this to make arrows; I put the tape directly on my lab tables and it makes it easy for the students to know which way to rotate. This is so much better than making masking tape arrows, like I used to, because this Post-It tape comes off cleanly and without any trouble whatsoever.These are only 2 of many uses- highly recommended!!"
677,"Quick and simple review: these tabs are great. They're easy to put on/remove, all you have to do is write on them, and you get 40 in the pack. Great deal, great product; highly recommended."
677,"I really liked the idea of these Post-it notes, but they could definitely be improved. One of the sticky ends isn't nearly sticky enough, causing the Post-it to peel easily. In addition, one sticky end has the glue right along the top, while the other is set a little off the edge. This leads to peeling too. If the glue was stickier and both sticky strips were right along the edge, this would be a five-star product....but it's not :(."
677,"I really like this wrist support. I've had it for about 2-3 weeks at this point, and I feel like it provides my wrists a lot of support for better typing posture. The materials seem very high quality and durable; I have a feeling I will have this wrist support for quite a long time. I would definitely recommend it!"
677,"Not much more needs to be said other than it's tape- it sticks, it's clear, it works just like it's supposed to. Scotch tape is always good!"
677,"Although the paper has a bit of a different feel than 3M Post-It notes, these Avery notes do the job. They stick, they are re-positionable, they do not leave residue, and they are not overly expensive. I would definitely recommend them if you don't mind getting something other than the Post-It brand!"
677,"These tabs work wonderfully as dividers in my binder. I love that I can color-code sections so easily. They are also re positionable, so if you write on them in pencil, you can totally re-use them in the future. They're a must-have for organizing 'freaks' like me!"
677,"In my opinion, the product description made it seem like this mechanical pencil was going to be marvelous and magical with its ""constant sharp tip"" and ""diamond-infused lead."" I'd have to agree that the pencil has a higher quality than most others- the lead definitely does not break as easily, and the pencil just feels more durable than the cheap ones you can buy in any store. If you're a pencil enthusiast, perhaps this is the one for you. However, I don't mind clicking my pencil a few times if the lead breaks or if I want a sharper tip. I'm happy with my pack of 8 mechanical pencils for half the price that do the same job :). Not the writing utensil for me, but perhaps it is for you!"
677,This little tape dispenser is perfect for many things like wrapping gifts and scrapbooking. The tape is durable and the dispenser is easy to use- you can just use it to apply the amount of tape you need instead of trying to estimate how much tape to tear off a roll. I think it's a great little tool!
677,"I love this super glue. It holds very well- I mainly needed it to glue some parts of my athletic shoes that were peeling. The bond is strong, and the longer applicator tip made it SO much easier to put the glue where I needed it. I used a different brand on super glue to hold a part of the sole of my shoe that was peeling (the shoes sure get a lot of use!!!), and while that glue is still holding too, that brand was messier in terms of application. This Scotch super glue works just as well as the other brand and is easier/less messy to apply- that gives it a one-up on the other brand in my eyes. Recommended!"
677,"I really like these sticky notes. They are just as good as 3M in terms of ""stickability"" and easy removal without residue. The feature I like the best is the stair-step; each color of sticky notes is slightly larger than the last. The 2nd set in, the yellow notes, is the standard 3 x 3; the orange set is about 3 x 2.5 because of the black binding strip. The largest set, the pink notes, is 3 x 5.Each color is perforated right below the binding and the sticky notes tear off easily. You do not have to use up all the orange before you can get to a color underneath it; each color is separate and can be used at any time.It's a neat idea for a product, and if you use a lot of sticky notes/prefer different sizes, I'd definitely recommend these."
677,"I am a teacher and tried these out last Friday. I use my whiteboard all the time, so I figured these would be a great solution for easily cleaning my board without having to use any sprays. The white spongy side worked fine- not great, but fine- it took off the marker and left some ghost writing, just like my standard erasers do. I read the instructions about getting the sponge wet to remove the ghost writing, so I tried it...all it did was smear any writing that was there (I tried it both with writing on and off the board) and leave huge water marks behind.Before writing this review, I came to see what others were writing and I was really confused with all the 4-5 star ratings on these erasers. I figured I did something wrong, so I gave the erasers a second chance. I tried again- following the instructions, as I thought I did before- and had the same problems. I was comforted to see another low review from someone who experienced similar problems.Since these are just sponges, they don't seem like they're going to last very long. I'd rather stick with my standard whiteboard erasers that are less expensive but do the job just fine."
677,These envelopes are nice overall. They seal well and I like the self-adhesive. The reason I gave them 4 stars is because they're supposed to be tamper-proof....I sealed one and opened it and didn't notice the letters that were supposed to appear.
677,"This doesn't need an in-depth review...it's simply a great binder. Strong, sturdy, and of better quality than the ones you can get for $1 at back to school sales....if you need something nicer, this is the way to go."
677,"I love this tape dispenser when it comes to wrapping presents. It makes it so easy because 1) it's not hard to find the edge of the tape; if you lose the tape end on a ""normal"" roll, as we all know, sometimes it tears funny and is difficult to re-start, and 2) ""regular"" dispensers take two hands (unless you're super skilled at using one) to tear a good piece of tape off. This takes all the extra work out of the process because each piece you pull prepares the next one for you. If you want to make the tape pieces last longer, you could easily cut them in half (they're pretty big), but then the dispenser loses some of its simplicity :).Ingenious product. Highly recommended!"
677,"These folders are really nice- as others have said, the fact that they are heavyweight means they'll last a long time. I'm a teacher and I use manila folders all the time. They get pretty beat up after using them all the time; I have a feeling that these will last much longer.As for the ""but..."" part of my review- yes, the tabs are larger, but they are mainly larger in terms of going down instead of increasing width. Yes, they are wider, but they also go down the folder farther (the cut away indent of the front folder piece goes deeper than on regular manila folders). This vertical space gets lost when you put a piece of paper in the folder, as that space gets covered (look at the picture and think about where that piece would fit in the folder. The bottom half of the ""larger tab"" totally gets cut off).Again, they're nice folders, and the tabs are slightly larger in terms of width, but the increase in vertical writing space doesn't matter since papers will cover it up anyway. But these folders are definitely going to be more durable than regular manila folders as they are heavyweight."
677,"I use sticky notes all the time, but I never tried Avery brand before. They are bright, colorful, not overly or ""underly"" sticky, and they are quite affordable. I'd definitely recommend them!"
634,"When purchasing binders, one needs to consider the use you have intended for them.  There are two things I look at,  the cover and the rings.  As a teacher and a mom, I have a lot of experience with binders.The cover:If I am simply going to put papers in them and store them on the shelf, I like the hard binders.  I use this type for filing recipes and documents I need to access.  Since they are stiff they are easy to shove back onto the shelf.  In the classroom these also work better, as they are less likely to slip off the shelf than the flexible cover binders.However, I find that buying hard binders for my kids leads to problems.  The kids like to stuff these into their backpacks, and the edges where the plastic is sealed quickly start to peel off, and the covers get folded over.  For them, I have found that a flexible binder in general will make it farther though the school year.  They will sometimes crack along the spine, but usually not enough to make the binder unusable, and a little duct tape will fix it.The rings:The second thing to look at is the rings.  The best ones (in my opinion) are the D shaped, as they hold more, with the little dimple on one side that fits into a depression on the other side.  This prevents papers from getting caught as you flip through.  They also hurt less if you snap them onto your fingers!  The other closure (a zig zag) tends to get misaligned over time with hard use, and the sharp edges hurt more if you close them on your fingers.This binder has a clear front in which to slip a cover, and more importantly if you are filing on a shelf, an insert area along the spine.  I am a fan of this extra, and have found that printing on cardstock, then laying the binder on a flat surface makes it easy to insert the label .  It also has  circular rings but they  do have the more desirable dimple to hollow closure.  It will lay flat when open.  There are two clear plastic pockets on EACH inside, one taller and one shallower for shoving in some papers at the front and back  (since this is such a huge binder, the front pocket is actually extra wide) for a total of 4 pockets.  That is a nice addition.  The cover does have that wrinkled look."
634,"3M got it right with this wrist rest.  The gel is firm enough to provide good support but cushy enough for comfort.  The underside is some sort of slightly sticky plastic that does not leave any residue nor harm the surface of your desk.The antibacterial properties are neither here nor there.  Unless you are washing your keyboard daily you already have microbes everywhere.It looks good, it feels good and it does what it says it will do.  If you need a wrist rest this is an excellent choice."
634,"These are really nice, especially at the price point/value offered.  5 ml is perfect for giving a little stiffness and still remaining somewhat flexible.  As a teacher I go through a lot of laminating pouches and have found that it actually pays to get something decent if the objects you are going to laminate will be used often.  These had no bubbles and turned out crystal clear when run through my cheap laminating machine."
634,"Regular ballpoint will work, the kind with liquid ink smears and Sharpie is the best. You can actually carefully remove Sharpie from them with nail polish remover, but if you get it on the sticky part you are out of luck.I actually sometimes cut these in half to get more, as they are fairly expensive.  I used these ""half""pieces to make Alphabet labels from A to Z for our cd collection.  Write on them with Sharpie and stick onan empty cd holder and you have an easy divider.  My son also uses these on his sheet music, easy to flip to the right spot during a performance (and they do remove without tearing if you are careful).I really like them, sturdy, stiff and have lots of uses, but the price is pretty high for using just for regular filing.  For special uses I do find them worthwhile."
634,"These are great for indexing things that you need to reference quickly and often.  Some uses they have been put to in our house are....1) Marking the AR, ER and IR verbs in a Spanish textbook for easy conjugating2) Attached to paper cd envelopes filed in a box to find the ones used most often3) Favorite recipes in a cookbook4) Labeling the page with unit conversions in a science text5) Added and removed to the kids weekly agendas for school so they can quickly turn to the right week (they have been switched for 5 weeks (5 times) )and are still holding6) Dividing up a binder into sections. For this we used cardstock, and the tabs are strong enough to turn the pages using the tabWe have not had any issue with removing them, other than you do need to hold the paper down when lifting the tab to avoid tearing.  No ink removal, or fibers, but the paper does have a glossy type finish in the ones that have been moved."
634,"Good:  They are quickly removable and can be easily repositioned but stick very well.  I stuck them on paper file folders, glass jars, plastic bags and plastic folders.Bad: You can only send the sheet through the printer once, so if you just need a couple of labels you will waste a lot of them or you will have to handwrite them.I found a fantastic use for these though.  My kid is doing number lines in school.  He was taking forever to do his homework as he had to draw a number line for each problem.  These can be used to make stickers with number lines (really just a line with cross hatches).  Because they are repositionable you can actually line up a couple of them if you need a longer number line and all you have to do is add arrows and the numbers.  We made some with the standard -10 to 10 labeled every other line since a lot of the problems are in this range.  I know this is a fairly specific problem, but I can see how they would be useful for many repetitive type tasks like this.I think the large full size labels would be great for scroll saw work, based on these file folder labels stickiness but I have not tried them.  Print out your design and cut around it."
634,"These are sturdy and well designed folders.  The cardboard is significantly sturdier than the cheapo folders I usually buy for filing.  The top is folded in a manner that makes them less likely to tear.  The tabs are large and easy to write on, but do not stick up too high to close the filing cabinet.The biggest issue with these is cost.  I would restrict using them for files you use a great deal.  For stuff you file once and do not look at for several years these folders would be overkill.  For files you access often, these folders work quite well."
634,"These highlighters come in a nice reusable pouch.  The flap can be folded back so that the markers are slightly elevated from the surface, making it easy to remove them and replace them while using.  Click to retract is a great idea, as one is often using highlighters intermittently.The tips are fairly narrow, making a line of a width of about 3mm, I like this, as I am often underlining in books with small text but if you want a highlighter to cover large areas fast you need to chose a different type.The colors are nice, but darkness of the blue,red and purple make reading text underneath them fairly difficult, unless the printing is very bold.  I am deducting a star for this, as they are marketed as highlighters and one should be able to read text underneath them."
634,"Nice that it has printed on each sheet that it is compatible with Avery 5366. I hate having to find the box each time to figure out what template to use.In Word 2007 you can download a template for Avery 5366 (Go to the pulldown menu under the four color icon, select ""New"" and type 5366 in the search box at the top.  Choose which of the formats you like and click Download.)I like to make my file folder labels in Excel and then do a Mail Merge to print them on the labels.  That way I have the labels as a file in excel and can modify them or reprint them at will.  These worked fine with Mail Merge.Printed well on my inkjet printer, no feeding problems or smearing."
634,"I love Post-it notes and have them all over my house.  This holder is a nice addition, it can be stuck pretty much anywhere  (other than fragile paint or wallpaper).  I put mine inside the bathroom cabinet, for all those things I remember in the middle of the night and for leaving reminder notes for my kids and husband.It comes with 4 strips of interesting adhesive.  It is sort of like Velcro, only plastic and both sides are the same and look like millions of little pin heads.  It is strong, and easy to use.  The holder uses the accordion style Post-its.The pen slot is too short, the one design flaw for which I am removing a star.  A skinny pen falls out too easily.  The slot should have gone all the way up the side of the dispenser."
634,"The absolutely best thing about these labels is that they will cover up whatever is printed on the box you are trying to use.  This allows you to reuse pretty much any box for shipping.I tried the helpful hints from FlyingPolarBear  about how to print them without a receipt for USPS, UPS and paypal in order to save labels and they worked like a charm.However, they are a bit on the expensive side, so I will probably reserve them for when I am resusing a box and stick to the off brand when I have a fresh new shipping box."
1298,"This wrist rest is a great size for work with a desktop mouse. It supports the wrist without any pressure points. I have used a lot of different wrist rests for years, as they are important for ergonomic comfort.  The 3M Gel Wrist Rest does the job, it doesn't slip around on my desk. I have used it with my Steel Series mouse pad without problems. It's large enough to support larger wrists, but not too big for taking it with you on the road.  Has antimicrobial protection built in."
1298,"I have been using Scotch Tape for I can't count how many years. Remember the cellophane tape? The stuff was sticky, yellowed and messy. Then along came Scotch Brand Magic Tape, invented by 3M in 1961. It was an improvement on the cellophane tape.  You can handle it without tangling. It cuts easily and sticks cleanly. You can write on it and its almost invisible. The dispenser was also a 3M invention.Whether you are looking for a roll of tape for wrapping presents or fixing a torn bill or sticking a label on a box, Scotch Brand Magic Tape is the one to choose."
1298,The GBC Laminator is a well made product. Small footprint and sleek design. The laminator heats up fast ~2 minutes. The laminator does well sealing the pages. Can use the 3 or 5 mil plastic.
1298,"These notes are really sticky. They don't fall off the surface they get stuck to. They leave no marks, come in an assortment of colors and the size is 3x3 inches, good enough for most notes. A good alternative to the post it notes."
1298,"I used these labels in my HP inkjet printer without any problems. Since they are permanent adhesive, they will not come off. The big size works well to use on boxes and storage boxes. I am organizing my junk closet with these labels. A quality product."
1298,"I like this product as it is convenient and ingenious.Convenient because you have pre-cut tape in just the right length for just about any wrapping or mending need. If you need something that's longer than 2"" you need to look elsewhere.It's ingenious because the dispenser holds on any smooth surface, without leaving a mark. The rubber suction cup on the bottom is floppy and adheres to the surface by a slight suction and tension. You just need to push down on it slightly. It is easy to move or remove but does not come loose when you dispense a piece of tape.Scotch brand tape is better than the cheap off brand tapes out there. It is clear and the adhesive is strong.The tape pack is replaceable."
1298,"then you will love these labels. The Post-It brand labels are marked for laser printers, but they worked in my HP inkjet with a little bit of ink bleed. They stick on things yet remove easily with no residue left.The colors are bright and easy to see. You could probably use these as address labels because they stick so well.These are the same dimensions as the Avery 5160 labels. The come in four different colors with 30 labels per sheet.I used them for gift tags on my Christmas presents!"
1298,"These envelopes work well in my ink jet printer. They are easy to seal and the adhesive hold tight. No more licking the flap to get a tongue cut, Yikes!The paper is sturdy and the envelope is well made."
1298,"With the Avery Ink Jet Printer Labels I can reuse shipping boxes without having to remove the old label.These work in my HP and Canon ink jet printers. When printing I only print the label and not the receipt, so as not to waste a label.The labels adhere to the boxes or envelopes without a problem. The bright white surface is easy to read the printing.Avery has a lot of templates on their web site for Word, etc."
1298,The dispenser is a convenient way to deliver pre-cut pieces of Scotch Tape. It's great for wrapping presents. It's refillable. A quality product but I don't see myself using it for many other uses.
1298,"You can use this roll of Post-it tape for labeling. Just what I did on boxes of stuff. If you don't have a label maker this is a cheap way to label stuff. It sticks well to surfaces. Just remember it's not a permanent solution, just temporary."
1298,"These are high quality sticky labels. There are cheaper brands out there, but if you want the best in labels then the 3M Permanent Adhesive Address Labels will fill the bill.No problems running these in my ink jet printer, they stay on the sheet until you remove them.  The ink does soak in a bit but not so much that it runs or anything like that."
438,"I really liked these 3M Shipping Labels, permanent adhesive: I used them with the 5163 Avery template in Microsoft Word, with absolutely no problems!  They stuck very well both on cardboard and shipping tape: I have used Avery labels in the past and have really liked them, and these 3M labels seem to me to be a great substitute!  They were very easy-to-use, stuck well, the Avery template worked perfectly, and they stuck to the appropriate packaging well!I would definitely recommend these, especially if you are looking for a substitute for the Avery ones, without giving on the quality side: these are a nice thickness, without being too bulky, and are still easy to peel & adhere: loved them!"
438,"Avery's ticket stubs are a useful product: templates are available online, with some basic set ups and info you can use to create some GREAT Tickets yourself, which include tear aways stubs (totally useful).  These are intended for INK JET, and worked great out of printer with no issues: I was satisfied with the templates and with the final product: another recommended product from Avery."
438,"I really liked these 3M Shipping Labels, with permanent adhesive: I used them with the 5160 Avery template in Microsoft Word, with absolutely no problems! They stuck very well both on cardboard and envelopes, and pretty well to shipping tape (both USPS Priority tape & packaging tape, although it sticks much better to the cardboard & envelopes): I have used Avery labels in the past and have really liked them, and these 3M labels seemed to me to be a great substitute! They were very easy-to-use, stuck well, the Avery template worked perfectly, and they stuck to the appropriate packaging as address/shipping labels well!I would definitely recommend these, especially if you are looking for a substitute for the Avery ones, without giving on the quality side: these are a nice thickness, without being too bulky, and are still easy to peel & adhere: loved them!"
438,"I really quite liked the Avery Note Tabs that are repositionable: I tried this in my monthly calendar on a one of the months: it's plain paper, and it was easily able to be repositioned: it is on there sturdy though!  I don't know how long it will be repositionable (will it stick for good, if I leave it on there for awhile), so that is my current test: I will come back & update when I can!I like that fact that the sticky part is see-thru: it keeps it from blocking the information I have there where I am adding the tab, making the tab more useful!  It also is easily written on, which I did with an ultra fine point sharpie: really liked this neat little product: I'm going to use it to organize a notebook of records/files: it will make it SO much easier to quickly get to the section I want to!  If I have any left after doing that notebook, I'm going to organize my house file and my recipe binders!  Yay Avery for creating a useful product!!"
438,"The banker boxes organizations boxes quick and easy to simple and very grateful putting things in.  The down side would be over time they would get kind of dirty and dingy however, and they're not particularly big, but they are a good tall size and you can put all kinds of things inside!  They do look very nice on your shelves and other benefit is you can buy multiple of them, put them all on shelves together and they look very uniform and clean and modern!  The price I think is a bit steep for what you get, which is basically nice study, pre-cut and designed cardboard, So I would only recommend these if you are looking for nice sturdy easy to assemble cardboard boxes for your office that are all uniform and you don't mind spending the extra money.  Would recommend, Just know what you're getting."
438,"What can I say, these great Avery flags, in standard colors (red, orange, yellow, green and blue) are a great office product: multiple purpose, easy-to-use and removable!  This set of 100 flags can be used to mark papers (where to sign), where to return to read (in your favorite book), highlight a certain area in a document, etc.  I find all sorts of uses for these flags, and my favorite part is they can be removed and re-used multiple times and are definitely multi-use along with that. Another great Avery product: would recommend!"
438,"Scotch tape is just all around great tape - this 3 pack of Scotch Magic Tape comes with 3 reasonable sized rolls - not big, they tend on the small size, but perfect to distribute some Scotch tape in a few areas of your house - your office, kitchen drawer & downstairs...this matte finish tape is perfect for many uses and can be compared to something like Oreo cookies: a great brand everyone knows & loves, and in the case of Scotch Magic tape, always keeps on hand (some people do that with Oreos too ;)...) - the price is reasonable, the product is great with many, many uses - I would recommend!"
438,"I really quite liked the Avery Note Tabs that are repositionable: I tried this in my monthly calendar on one of the months: it's plain paper, and it was easily able to be pulled off and repositioned: it is on there sturdy though, and allows me to quickly access the current month!

438,"I really liked these 3M Post-It Super Sticky Removable File Folder Labels:The use: I am a big fan of 1/3 cut tabbed file folders (I use them all the time), and I usually write with an ultra fine point sharpie, the name of the folder in the tab area.  This is permanent and works well, but the problem always comes when I no longer need a folder with that particular name: it looks ugly to use white-off over it (correction fluid), and since it is permanent, I can't erase it, and I don't like striking thru it and writing it below (I'm too much of a neat freak): I'm not fond of pencil for this use, so I usually would end up throwing away a perfectly good folder that would be re-usable, because I couldn't re-name it: with these new REMOVABLE 3M file folder labels, PROBLEM SOLVED for me!I tested this, and I put one of these labels over the sharpie on a folder, and I could barely see it ~ with a new title written on the removable label, it's not really noticeable: now I will be able to RECYCLE and RE-use my file folders when I need to re-name them.  I a big fan of this product for that use: as far as other uses of these labels, I'll leave that to others to discover: and I'm really happy to be able to be more 'green' this way...These removable labels are great, and highly recommended for use with 1/3 cut file folders, for the purpose of RECYCLING and highlighting folder names!"
438,"I really liked these 3M Shipping Labels, with permanent adhesive: I used them with the 5167 Avery template in Microsoft Word, with absolutely no problems!

438,"These 3M whiteboard erasers are PERFECT for grad school students!  I carry one of these, along with a dry erase marker, in my school bag - anytime I need to do show some calculations, marketing bullets, etc., I just whip this out and use!  It works very well, and is super-light to carry around - so I don't worry about the extra weight...I'd highly recommend these 3M erasers, for student and office use!"
438,"Nice set of markers with some real pros and cons.  Pros: These dry-erase markers come in beautiful colors, bright, bold ink and a generous pack of 12 markers for the price. The chisel tip is decently nice, writes well, ink flow is great!  The cons: these dry-erase markers are difficult to erase, don't come off easily, the ink leaks, ebbs and flows strangely, and is sometimes much lighter in color than other markers available. This makes it harder to see. Personally, I love the idea here: the colors, the clear windows (so you can see when the ink runs low), the bright ink: all wonderful!  It's the leakiness, the incosistency and the difficulty to erase that will make me stick to Expo markers for now or keep both around for a time and see who outlast the others: Expo markers have their own concerns, but overall I have found them to be more reliable to others."
438,"Yeah, so I didn't really 'get' how these were secured - you raised the lower flap & used the adhesive that revealed to seal the envelope...then, if someone opened that on the sides, it was supposed to show this...um, I didn't see any secure features that are supposed to make this tamper-proof...it's supposed to say 'opened' in red if anyone tampers with it - I saw no evidence of this at all.  I'm confused - maybe the description is wrong?  The box just says 'Reveal-N-Seal Business Envelopes' and basically looks to be regular envelopes with a long-lasing adhesive, not tamper-proof, tamper-revealing envelopes.  They appear to be find normal envelopes that blocks light for things like checks, but the mentioned extra security features were not here - would not really recommend - there are better normal secure envelopes and better extra security envelopes out there.  I would not 'buy' these again."
438,"I have used a lot of different types of binders over the years - in my jobs, at school, at home, in training, etc...this binder is in the top results I've used, as it comes with some of my favorite features - good ring/lock, good ring shape, pockets in front & back inside (extra pockets in this one, so it gets a bonus for that!), clear view - for inserting papers in the front, spine & back outside...it's also longer than the average binder, so it works well with tabs/dividers, etc.This is exactly what it says - durable, easy to use, with pockets, clear view, good size...it loses one star for not having the easy touch (which I have newly discovered), but for a standard, durable binder, it gets 4 thumbs up - a great product to last hard use & a long time - I would recommend it!"
438,"I liked this little Scotch tape dispenser: I think it's useful for wrapping a bunch of gifts, especially Christmas presents around this time of year!  Mine came in a pink color, which was fun, and nicely dispensed a bunch of two inch, pre-cut sized pieces of tape: nice when wrapping!  The wrist part got a little bit in my way, but not a lot: I would say that it seems to be on the expensive side, and that refills are expensive and not super-easy to find...I would say my biggest complaint is that it doesn't hold enough if you are doing a LOT of wrapping, so you would need to keep a few refills handy!  And the refills are a bit expensive, so I don't know how cost effective it is: I would say it all comes down to paying the extra money vs. the ease of use & convenience it provides!Personally I'm happy with the cheaper regular tape, either in the regular plastic dispensers, or in the heavier, office weighted dispensers: both ways are reasonably easy-to-use, even when wrapping Christmas presents: and you can always prepare a piece of tape or two & stick them to the side of the dispenser to grab while wrapping: that's what I usually do...so I would recommend this as a neat product, but on the expensive side, and not amazing..."
1198,I have used some of these boxes for- long term storage- moving things from one house to another- `hauling boxes' to take books to a resellerWhat I like about these boxes- Quickly comes together to form box- Top is integrated into the box so there is not the problem of the missing top- Sturdy (holds heavy times such as books )- Handles provide an excellent comfortable grip even when filled with heavy itemsOnly draw back is the top/lid of the box does not lay completly flat.
1198,"This item has 4 sections with three perorations to customize the size.Things I like1. Even on light weight paper (like those in the dummies books) it does not damage the paper or remove ink even when take off and placed back on several times2. Very easy to read text through the plastic3. Even Sharpies do not bleed through this heavy plastic4. The first section with the `tab' makes a great tool for marking chapters or frequently referenced sections5. Heavy duty (stays put even when turning heavy pages)6. I ended up tearing the other three sections off (all 4 sections were really too long for the books I was using them with).  Separated from the tab I used them toa. Folding two tabs over each other again became a great place holder that I used to take notes on.b. Each section by themselves attach flat and neatly on the page a great place to put notes that look much better than the typical sticky and more secure than a piece of paperWhat bothered me1. As noted above the full length of the tab was too long for the books I was using.  Might be great for  a 8.5 x 11 inch page but not the books I was using2. While it did not remove text on lightweight pages when run up and down on the page the page ended up curling.This is a great tool for helping organize notes, make notations in books, and mark chapters or places of interest in a non-destructive manner.  If you are primarily looking for heavy duty page tabs  I recommend consideringAvery NoteTabs Round Edge, 2 x 1.5 Inches, Neon Blue and Magenta, 20 per pack (16305)"
1198,The final finish is not overly glossy but not too matteIt is easy to fill and seals consistently without wrinkles (might be in part due to the thickness of photo paper vs regular paper)
1198,I have been very impressed with this new line of Avery products.Like others in this line I can place this and lift it off several times (have done it 8x and still feel it adheres readily and securely).I have been using these to help keep track of my meeting notes and my to do items.These have also been helpful in organizing information for special projects I am working on.  I use the tab to note a place in a book then use the square surface to note how I see implanting the information into the project.These are fairly thick and durable.  And that is the one draw back for me.  I wish these were just a bit thinner.  However that does not distract too much from this great inovative product.
1198,I like to reuse my files however I also do not want to stack label on top of label or tear a regular label off a file and have an unsightly torn mess.I love these labels because1. They come off cleanly2. Label lifts off on surfaces (able to move 7x and still felt it was adhering securely)3. Feeds cleanly through both my top and bottom feeding printers4. Ink adheres well to the surface with no smudges5. When using a marker like a sharpie it does not bleed through to the surface below
1198,"Places these to not hold up1. Any surface with a curve or that is uneven2. Any surface that is dusty or dirty (attempted on a wall that had spackle from fixing a whole in the drywall - did not stick)3. Did not stick well to the cloth on my cubical wallWhat surprised me1.  They do gain back sticky when rinsed.  I took the one that feel of the spackle surface and initially it did not want to stick.  Rinsed it, let it dry and stuck it under my cabinet.  Now 24 hours later it is still holding a little LED light that has 3 AAA batteries.2. States each square can old .25 oz.  I suspect that the light alone is more than that and with the 3 AA batteries it has definitely gone beyond that weight.  Yet it still holds.3. I used it to tack a small remote to a I-POD speaker to the back of the speaker.  The small remote is still hanging there several days later.4. The squares are clear.  I can see them being great for anchoring down items in a display.  Much more tacky than putty and less `tacky looking'.5. I am going to use these to tack down some items around my desk (anchor a small USB hub to the bottom of my monitor, anchor a CF card reader to the side of my computer.  What is great is that I can easily `unstick' the item and move it when needed.I was thinking of using them to mount photos in a matless frame however they seem a bit too thick for that use."
1198,These tabs are great for marking chapters in a book or frequently used pages.What I like:1. they are heavy duty2.  even on light paper do not damage the paper or remove the ink from the page.3. nice large surface for writing on4. lift off easily5. can be lifted off and put back on several times (I have done it 5 x and they still adhered well)
1198,Like most Avery product this is a great way to create professional looking tickets at home.Ink from my inkjet and laser printer adheres well.  The finished look is clean and professional.  --  Great for non-profit and school events.Also like most Avery product it always seems to cost more than I really want to pay.
1198,The package I received has 4 sheets each of the following colors:A bright pink (however not what I would call neon)Strong solid yellowLime green (bordering on neon)Pastel blueI took one label on and off surfaces 8 times.  Each time it lifted off easily without damaging the paper or lifting off ink.  Even after 8 lifts and place even the corners of the sticker laid flat.The sheets move easily through my top feeding inkjet printer and my bottom feeding laser printer.Sharpies do not bleed through the paper to the surface below.Since all of the back of the sticker is sticky it does not crumple or catch like the typical office sticky note; however unlike most labels it does not damage the surface of the paper/folder when you lift it off.
1198,"These are good basic plain all purpose 4 1/8"" x 9 1/2"" envelopes(note as of today the picture on the Amazon page does not match the product)Things I like1. No waste -  most self sealing envelopes have a plastic strip that needs to be lifted off.  With these all you need to do is lift the flap and seal.  No extra mess.  The flap seems to be fully recyclable.2. The envelopes have a blue security printing on the inside.  This makes it difficult to see printed material inside the envelope.3. Once sealed remain sealed.  I tried to open a sealed envelope right after closing.  The flap tore in clearly indicating that the envelope was tampered with.Things that were awkward but not deal breakers1. It took a bit to hold the flap up so the envelope could seal.  Nothing big but just a moment or two of extra dexterity2. Looking at the box I see no note of recycled content.  Typically when purchasing office paper products I like product that have recycled content. Again not a deal breaker.3. The paper appears rather thin but with the security imprinting the contents are not revealed.  But overall appears as durable as any basic envelope.Over all basic envelope with a nice sealing feature."
1198,This was easy to mount and I also feel it will come off easy as well when I need it to.I like that I was able to choose how close or how far apart I wanted to place the hangers.  This allowed me to place it securely on a narrow (apx 1-inch) foot for my monitor riser.  The pen and Post-its are in convenient reach where I need it the most but yet not cluttering my desk space. (see picture)The hook-like hangers allow for the Post-It holder to be easily removed and the pull away mounts remove easily from surfaces (I've used them on painted walls and have been able to remove them with no damage to the wall or paint).
1198,"As with any label, creativity is endless - however the size makes it great for a variety of uses such as1. Covering large envelopes for reuse (the TrueBlock blocks out what is underneath)2. Placed on side of boxes for labeling content (note because it does adhere so well it does not lift of easily)3. Custom decorative signsWhat I like about these particular labels:1. Thick heavy label2. Adheres and once stuck stays stuck (edges did not peal up)3.   page size allows for lots of space for creative projects4. Ink dries without smearing (tried on an Epson and  Brother inkjet printers as well as a laser)5. Feeds well on both a top load and bottom feed printers (bottom feed was a laser)"
481,This package of pens is a good deal for the price.  The ink flows well and the eight bright colors are great. These pens seem to be of about the same quality as the ones that you get from businesses with their advertising on them.  What I don't like is the grip.  The bottom end of the grip near the point of the pen is smooth and slippery.
481,"This dispenser works fine and if you need pre-cut pieces of tape, this is for you.  I, however, am very happy with my roll of Scotch Tape. When I use my roll of tape, I can cut pieces of various sizes as needed. This gadget would ensure that kids don't waste tape, but on the other hand the refills for this are very expensive."
481,"Wow!  These little tape dispensers are great.  Although they are higher priced than buying rolls of tape, I think there will be less waste.  This pack has enough dispensers for everyone in the house.  They would make great little stocking stuffers for Christmas."
481,"I love the four neon colors of these labels.  If you store children's clothing in plastic bins, these are great to help keep your clothing organized.  These labels make it easy to see at a glance what you have stored in the bins.We are also using these at an outreach mission for the poor in Appalachia where a lot of clothing is donated.  You can quickly put a label on each box and mark what it contains to help keep inventory organized and easy to find.I am pleased to find another great 3M product made in the USA."
481,These are very handy little dispensers.  You can stick them to any smooth surface.  They take up very little space compared to other Post-it dispensers.  My grandson had great fun using these to write orders on while playing restaurant today. You can never have too many Post-its!
481,These labels work great with my laser printer and they stay where you put them.  I am happy to find a product made here in the USA since it is getting more difficult every day to find products made here.  Thank you 3M!
481,"These tabs are just what I needed to mark recipes in my many cookbooks.  As I have gotten older and cook less because the kids are gone, I find that I sometimes cannot find a favorite old recipe as quickly as I used to.  These tabs are perfect.  I am using them to mark the pages in all my cookbooks that have recipes that I make occasionally.I am using the magenta colored tabs on all dessert recipes and the blue one for everything else.  Yes, you guessed it I love desserts and about half of my recipes are for desserts.  The tabs adhere easily and can be removed and repositioned, and I wrote the names of the recipes on the tabs.  My plan is to go through all my cookbooks this winter, and I am sure I will need to order more tabs.I highly recommend these great little tabs.  I am sure everyone will find different uses for them"
481,"These boxes exceeded my expectations.  I couldn't understand why anyone would buy boxes until I received these.  They are heavy duty cardboard and easy to assemble.  I like the built-in handles that make them easy to handle once you have filled them.  No tape is certainly a plus at my house where it seems we are always looking for the tape and wondering who used it last.These boxes are good for more than moving; they are great for storing seasonal items.  I put my over-sized winter comforter, the bedskirt, the fleece blanket, and sheet set, in this box to store until next winter since they took up way too much space in the closet.  I love it!"
481,"Scoth Magic is the best tape on the market.  I have bought it for years and will continue to do so.  It never yellows, and you can write on it.  It sticks and stay stuck unlike some cheaper tapes. The 3 pack is a great way to buy it for your household so you can have a roll in various places."
481,"Five bold colors in various sizes makes these notes a great item to have around.  Often times a small sticky note is just not large enough, but with the extra sizes in this package there is a note that is perfect for every job.  I love the bold colors and the adhesive on these sticks well."
481,"I found these envelopes while searching for envelopes to use for international mail.  I wanted something strong and secure, and this envelope suits my needs.  I love that it is self-sealing, which require no moisture to seal and it does not have a removable strip to dispose of as do other envelopes. I sealed one of these envelopes and let it set for a couple of hours, and I feel that it is tamper proof.  My attempt to open it, tore the envelope."
481,Ever wonder where you left your post-it note pad?  With this handy little dispenser you won't misplace your note pads again.  It's great that it also has a place for a pen.  These are handy for home and office.
481,"These are the handiest little notes to have around the house and office.  They stick when you want them to, and they come off easily and leave no mess.  My grandkids love them for play too, however, their mom was less than excited about the many, many notes hanging everywhere around the house!  The price is great too."
1107,"Can't imagine why any 3M product would need to be reviewed.  I have used all kinds of 3M products thru the years and have always had great results.  With so many reviews I don't know what more I can say about this product.  Like so many reviews have mentioned these labels have more than one use.I'm not much into label making, so the printing instructions is a nice touch. But for labeling boxes, bins, etc. this is a nice size label. And of course, they're great for mailing packages.I do have a laser printer, so after learning about making labels and doing a little tweaking to the software, I had a printed label.This might become a habit for making address labels; a lot neater and definitely more professional. The labels are easy to take off and place on the package.  Make sure of the spot where you want to stick the label tho; once on, it's on."
1107,"I used these tapes to wrap all the Christmas gifts, and still have plenty of tape left.  Putting the blue and pink dispensers over my hand (not at the same time; lol) is so handy because normally I would get a piece of tape and then throw the tape dispenser somewhere and would have to find it all over again the next time I needed a piece of tape.  With this dispenser over my hand I always knew where the tape was!  The only problem I had is figuring out how to get the cover back on when I put a replacement tape in.  Definitely recommended!"
1107,"My world is now complete, lol.  I love the imagination of the reviewers on what you can use these Post-its for; canning jars, color post-its for different sizes, and in my case to label Christmas boxes. One color for outside decorations and another color for inside decorations.They have so many uses, my only wish is to make them erasable. You can peel them off and on many times, which is great! So, why not erasable? ;)As I have written before in other reviews about 3M products, why do you need to review 3M?  It's from 3M, 'nuff said.  :-)"
1107,"The Post-It package said it all. Full adhesive label, sticks securely, and removes cleanly. Matter of fact, I have one sticking to the side of my computer to remind me to write this review.The package has suggestions for some of the uses of the label, such as sticking them on binders, bins, food containers and whatever else you can think up.  I didn't know they made such an item that sticks completely instead of just at the top.  All the post-its I have ever used just have glue on the top edge, so eventually the paper curls and falls off.  These came in vibrant green and pink colors.I wonder if they make these in the shape of a pink heart?  :-)"
1107,"These are great storage boxes and that is why I got them. When I saw the name Fellows, the maker of computer accessories, I hoped they would turn out to be as good as the rest of their products.The shipping box they showed up in was in pretty rough shape, which is why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 (one end was completely open).  After seeing the shipping box I wondered what the boxes inside would be like, but as it turned out they were all fine.When I took the first box out I was amazed at the ingenuity of making the box. The first thing that happens is when you unfold the box you automatically have three quarters of a bottom of the box. Next you look inside and push down the flooring which gives you almost 2 full layers for the bottom of the box. That alone tells you these boxes can hold some weight. Next you look at the top to see numbers 2, 3, 4 and 5. Follow the sequence and when you get to number 5 you need to push the cardboard handhold cutouts inside the box, fold flap 5 over and stick the cardboard tabs inside the handholds.  Now you have a secure cover for the top of the box and some extra padding for the handholds.When you look at the ingenuity and simplicity of this box, you scratch your head and wonder, how come I didn't think of this.  These would be great for moving or storage.  We moved last summer and of course we had a lot of ""stuff"" left over that had been stuck in the garage.  Now it's in boxes and tagged so we know what ""stuff"" is in each box.  And if we decide to move again (heaven forbid; lol) we'll be a step ahead of the game.  :-)"
1107,"This gel wrist rest covers not only the keyboard, but also a mouse.  It's a very comfortable firm gel and washes off easily.  Another wrist rest I have is a loft softer and has sprung a couple leaks; I do not think this one will do that.  I don't know how much I can say about a gel wrist rest, but if you want one that is extra long and comfy, this fits the bill."
1107,"I'm reviewing the 9-inch personal laminator.  It's so easy; turn the switch on the top right from the O to the 3 and wait for it to warm up.  I've had it warm up in about 3 minutes; I just laminated some more pages and it took almost 5 minutes to warm up. The machine does get warm, but not warm enough to burn yourself (or for a child who might accidentally touch it).Put whatever you're laminating in between the two pages of the laminating pouch, sealed edge first, and put the pouch in between the two marks on the laminator until it ""catches"" and then it slowly goes through the machine on its own and comes out the other end.  The first thing I laminated was a photo and obviously I didn't have the photo in exactly correct because it came out with a small crease, but that's the only time that's happened.  I have laminated knitting and crocheting patterns and even used two pages back to back in one pouch and it came out perfectly (thanks to one of the reviewers for the suggestion; I can't believe I hadn't thought of it myself).  I have laminated other photos by putting a few of them together in a 9"" x 11 1/2"" pouch and then cutting out the separate photos after they laminated. I try not to waste a pouch by only laminating a small item in it. It would also be great for your favorite recipes (I don't cook; I have a plaque with ""Why cook when you can knit"" on it; lol.This is a professional looking machine and could even be used in a small office. If you want to laminate larger items like posters the 12"" might be a better option, but I can't think of anything I would need the larger size for. It recommends 3 millimeter pouches, or 5 millimeter for laminating something up to 4"" x 6"".  And it's Swingline, so you know it's gotta be good.  I'm really impressed with it; I've been a laminating fool since receiving it; lol.  I've been searching the house (and my brain) for things to laminate.  I do a lot of scrapbooking and have lots of precious old pictures that were barely holding together; after laminating then I know they'll last.  The piece of mind knowing my old photos are protected is worth the price of the laminator.  The only option I would like it to have would be an automatic shut off after being idle for a few minutes.P.S. 5/6/13 - I was sitting eating breakfast and my hubby came out and asked if I had a page protector to put a couple maps in that he had just printed out.  I said yeah, but would you rather have them laminated?  He kinda smiled and said, well it will be getting lots of use.  So, I went and turned on the laminator and put the two printed sheets back to back in the pouch, went to brush my teeth and came back in time to see the green light come on.  I started the pouch through and went back to finish brushing my teeth.  When I was done I came back and got the laminated maps; viola!  The whole process took maybe 5 minutes; awesome!"
1107,"I do a lot of home laminating so I'm always looking for deals on laminating pouches.  I got the 100 pack of 3 mil pouches.  I measured the pouches and they barely fit an 8 1/2"" x 11"" page, so you need to get the page to be laminated in perfectly so the sides have a small overlap for the laminator to seam.  I used a Swingline GBC laminator that I got on a deal of the day before Christmas and the pouches work perfectly with it.  The pouches look a little cloudy but come out perfectly clear after being laminated.  There's a very small ripple on the end of the pouches even though I took them out of the machine right away.I used these pouches to laminate a couple membership cards and photos on one page and then laminated a few pages that had fallen out of a crochet book.  I find so many things to laminate and I'm amazed how well things look and how sturdy the pages are afterward.  I use the pouches on a lot of crochet and knitting patterns and then don't have to worry about the pages ripping.  They would also be great for recipes even though I don't cook (I have this plaque in the kitchen:  ""Why cook when you can knit"").  The 100 pack is the best deal.  If you're just getting started with laminating I would buy more pouches than you think you might need because you'll find more things to laminate than you thought! :-)"
1107,"This little thing is so handy!  I use to stock up on glue sticks and they were messy and it seemed like when I wanted to use them they had dried up.  Now I use this adhesive dot roller instead of having to lick envelopes, on scrapbook pages and whatever else needs to be stuck together.  It works so much better than a glue stick!"
1107,"Or at least stuck on file folders......... Actually on anything that you would need a label this size for.I don't have a print program that will work for these labels, so I do it all in pen. Write the needed info on the label, peel it off, and stick it on. The other benefit of these labels is if you're not happy with the results, peel it off and start over. How simple is that!I have reviewed a few Post-It products,and always wonder why 3M wants a review when it's 3M? What's not to like about 3M products? :-)"
1107,We've lived in our house almost two years but I've been afraid to put up anything on the walls.  Now with these reusable tabs I can and know that they won't destroy the walls.  `I just put up a calendar in my computer room.  :-)These work great; it's about time something like this is available!
1107,"I love the five bright colors and the fact that every colored note is a different size in a ""stair-step"".  Now I have different sizes for different uses.  My favorite color, the hot pink, is on the bottom of the pad and is almost twice the size as the orange that is on the top of the pad.  You can remove whichever color and size you want without having to break apart the whole pad.One of my favorite uses for these notes is to mark where I am in a knitting or crocheting pattern and I can move them many times before the stickiness is worn off.I wonder why no other company has thought about this stair-step design before; it's a great idea and cute too.  Avery has come up with a winner!  :-)"
1107,"These come in a two-pack; mine was pink and blue.  The pink one I have stuck to my laptop table and the blue one my hubby has stuck on his desktop table.  Seems it use to be whenever I wanted a post-it note I couldn't find one but now I always know exactly where they are!  No, it doesn't take the regular size post-it notes but when these run out I'll either buy the size that fits or cut some down to size.  I like it!"
1107,"This tape is not only in an easy to use plastic dispenser, but it's tough, won't break, and a great deal for a six pack!  I've paid over three buck's for one roll of this tape so this is a great bargain.  Works great for returning those packages to Amazon!  ;-0  Stock up for Christmas at this price!"
484,"Terrific way to add a small notation and flag a page....all without ruining your book or script!  I've tried a few items in this new Avery line, all have been good, but this and the other removable label products are superior to anything else out there. This would be a wonderful tucked into a card or as a stocking stuffer. If you or someone you know likes reading inspirational or self help books, these are fun to mark pages!"
484,I love these! Who needs a labelmaker when you can use these! I have them on everything from jars of jelly to file folders.  Peel them off without leftover goo. The little pad is perfect. I grow my own herbs and these are perfect to place on a zipper bag of dried herbs when there is enough bounty to share.
484,"Let me start by saying I have used the removable and permanent labels of every variety, every color. No, it isn't for a home office, it is for those of us that tend to forget things! I use these to label shoe boxes of items to be stored, as well as for shipping. They stay on and any type of ink can be used on them."
484,"This is something you think you don't want, the minute you have one you wonder why you didn't have one sooner. My tape winds up in a gadget drawer. The old dispenser gets crushed when I close the drawer, the tape gets grit and dust on it, and the tape gets off the cutting edge and then is immpossible to scratch from the roll. The flat design on this is perfect for me. It may seem like it costs more, but in the long run it's going to save money, no wasted tape! I love that I can buy refills. It is also very nice for folks with arthritis or hand dexterity issues."
484,"These are perfect for small fundraisers, or quickly planned fundraisers. You can go to a warehouse store and get a huge roll, but you'll buy more than you need and they won't be printed with your organisation's name.For a professional look on a pauper's budget, they are perfect."
484,"I love labels. LOVE LOVE labels. These are terrific, and totally re-stickable. They come in fun colors, and have never left any residue so far. Crazy as it may sound, they make a perfect gift, buy these and give packs to all your friends, each one will find a use for them!"
484,"I ride a motorcycle, and it's almost impossible to keep checking a paper stuffed in a glove for directions. These go on my tank with 'L at Main, R on Maple' etc. They dont fly off and I can glance down and know how to get to where I'm going! They peel right off when I'm done."
484,"Unless I recieved a factory second product to review, this binder is substandard.From the outside, it looks fine, although the spine is somewhat 'sloppy'.On opening, there is a basic 3 ring setting that works well, and double pockets on the front and back inside covers.The plastic is bubbled on both inside covers. Perhaps that is a manufacturing error, some factory in China messed up, right? Wrong. 'Assembled in the USA' embossed on one of the pockets.Hey, mistakes happen.I put a piece of paper in a pocket. Big mistake. I have fingernails but well manicured, not claws. Even so, the plastic covering, not even the pocket itself, dented from my nail.I've used other Wilson Jones products, most are quite good.One issue alone wouldn't make me hate this. All of them together mean you should skip this particular product.."
484,"Best invention since sliced bread! Easy on and off, great for avid readers who don't wish to mark up a book, or useful for editing a script copy. No damage, I really love these, as well as the half moon tabs. More colors please!"
484,"These are the perfect size for photos...glue a few magnets on the back and stick them on the refrigerator door.High school kids love these to make locker magnet photos.Good basic smaller size pouches, they go through the laminator well."
484,"After a life filled with snippets of paper that always wind up getting lost, these are TERRIFIC! They stick well, but here is the amazing thing...you can use them over and over! Yes, they are pricey, but when you consider they are reusable, they aren't bad. I'll be using them as gifts for all my friends who love books/organizing."
484,"This is a gadget lovers dream come true. Perfect for scrap booking, it is clean and the product rolls out well. I wont replace a product with this, but it's a nice fun addition to a crafter's toolbox."
484,"These are perfect for what they are. If you use them to label anything else, they really mean it when they say 'permanent'! I tried them on a variety of surfaces and needed goo-gone to remove the residue. I would give them all the stars, but one sheet seemed to have trouble in my sensitive printer."
484,"I was expecting something new and innovative. These are basically nothing more than security envelopes. Yes, they self seal, but as far as being able to tell if they are opened, not that great of a product."
2117,"I use file folders for my home paperwork (bills, Amazon.com invoices;) and after buying new ones every year, I have now started to recycle them. These labels are perfect for re-labeling those files.They are also large enough to be used for title labels for other folders, like printing out a e-book. There are templates available from 3M's website that I downloaded and had no problem using or printing from them."
2117,"I got these as a review product as part of the Amazon Vine.It is kind of hard to review an item like this, they're labels! They are sticky on one side and you print on the other (don't try it the other way). These are larger than most, good for Address labels for packages or title plates for folders and reports.As with all 3M labels, you can go to their website and download templates for your word processor that go with these labels.I play Role Playing Games and have a bunch of file folders full of e-books I printed out. These labels were the perfect size for getting them in order."
2117,"These are like the Post-it Notes we all use, but instead of a thin band of adhesive, these are almost all adhesive on the back. They work great as labels for file folders, storage boxes and especially anything you need a temporary label on (like who brought the Green Bean Casserole).It is the removable adhesive that makes these better than the usual mailing labels, as they to destroy the paper on a file folder when pealed off. And the uses these can have are almost endless; Moving Boxes, ID Badges, Ownership of Books, Software or Hardware, Instructions, Leftovers Identification, etc,."
2117,"After 15 years in retail and setting up store sections and plan-o-grams, one thing I noticed is how every section of the store has ""Iconic"" items. These items define the store section better than a hundred signs; the blue bottle of Windex, the orange bottle of Tide, etc.Many of these product even become the common name of the product and Scotch Tape is the name people ask for no matter what brand of tape they are looking for. And even now, it is still best tape you can buy. So many knockoffs have flimsy plastic holders, tape with no grip or that just won't tear, in fact the holder will usually break first ;)Personally I prefer the 3/4 inch tape, the others are just too thin to be useful and 300 inches should last a while, especially since you get three in this pack."
2117,"These are sort of a combination of note tabs, bookmarks, sticky notes and highlighter all in one.Each tab is 7.5 inches long, but perforated in three places so you can use them at shorter lengths as needed. Each has the sticky back of a post-it note, so you can use them and remove them several times.They are also translucent, so you can use them as a temporary highlighter for parts of a book or file you need a temporary reminder for.They can also be used as a simple bookmark, with the bonus of the sticky back keeping it from falling out of the book. Even when the sticky wears off, they should still be useful as a regular bookmark.I play Dungeons & Dragons, and one part of the game is referring back and forth thru several books. These look to be a great time saver when referencing materials."
2117,"I have used tape dispensers a lot at work and most are heavy and sometimes unwieldy. This one is very light and everything is self-contained within the dispenser, so it won't snag on things while you are using it.The tape does dispense easy and cuts easy, but it does have some drawbacks. Number one is it only uses a scotch refill. That limits you to clear tape and not brown package tape, the stronger fibered tape or weather resistant tape. It also is much smaller than the standard roll of packing tape, 900 inches (25 yards) vs 54 yards.If you use packing tape only occasionally, then this product will probably work for you. But if you ship a lot of stuff with Ebay or are packing a lot of boxes for a move or for storage, you would probably be better off with a commercial tape dispenser."
2117,"I have always used those accordion file holders to keep my year's worth of receipts in, but this year I decided to do things a little different. I got a ""milk carton"" hanging file holder and some hanging files. One problem. these files had tiny little tags for the tabs.But then I go these Post-it tabs, sorry, durable tabs. Yes, these aren't paper tabs, they are plastic tabs with a post-it adhesive backing. They are easy to write on with four bright colors if you want to organize your files by color or just bring a little color to your bills.They worked great and I expect them to last to the end of next year."
2117,"I play lots of Role Playing Games and pencils are preferred to pens for making maps, keeping track of stats, hit points and active spells. Regular pencils seem to lose their point so quickly, and I have tried mechanical pencils, but they just seem to break leads even more often.This one did not! I have wrote out several pages of material and not once did it break on me. There are a few things that could be better, the lead is a little light for my taste and I wish the packaging included some way to store the extra erasers with the leads or with the pencil.But overall, as a mechanical pencil, this one is the best at writing I have ever used."
2117,"If you have ever done scrap-booking, made a photo album or any kind of paper-craft hobby, you have probably made little dots of glue in a line. Well that is what this little device does.First, there's no mess. I would bet many people have given up on some paper-based hobbies because of the glue alone. With this device, you just roll the little dots on to the paper.The only negative, would be the price point, it does cost more than a bottle of Elmer's Glue, but it can be handy for envelopes that refuse to seal, stamps that have lost their sticky and for a quick scrap book craft item."
2117,"Anyone who has used superglue has probably glued things to their fingers, got it on their clothing or even in their eyes. It's not the fault of the glue, but of those little tubes it comes in. But Scotch has gotten it right with their precision applicator. This is so much easier to use, you can control how much and where it goes so much better. The glue doesn't leak out on you and how many time have you went back to an old tube to find it dried up? You don't have to worry about that with this applicator. And since you have better control, you get better results on the project you are working on.This will be my ""go to"" glue from now on."
2117,"These are return address labels, and despite being labeled for laser printers, you can use them in an ink jet printer as well.The quick lift feature is very nice, I have had labels that just would not let go of their paper. And as with all 3M labels, there are templates available online at [...].My only complaint is that they are smaller than I expected. But it is nice that you get 80 on a page, that means a single page will last me quite a while and with 2000 per pack, that's a lot of letters to send."
2117,"We have several Whiteboards at work to track our jobs and so I thought I would give these a try. They worked marvelously! With just a little water, these pads cleaned better than the ""whiteboard cleaner"" spray cleaner we normally use. No shadows left behind, no streaks and no smears. They even took off the spots where someone used a permanent marker. I had been trying to get those off since we put up the whiteboard.Now if you have used the Kitchen & Bath pads before, you know some of them will disintegrate with only a few uses. These have lasted much longer than most of the K&B; pads I have used. Also keep in mind, the less water you use, the longer they will last."
2117,"These envelopes are designed for both safety and self adhesive.The safety features include a blue pattern on the interior to prevent anyone from seeing what is inside thru the envelope and perforations on the flap that will tear if someone opens and reseals it. The self adhesive is a sticky strip under a waxy flap, so there is nothing to peal and toss. I found it works better than most lick and seal envelopes I have used.Are there better security envelopes out there? Yes, but for basic and home use, you can't beat the price on these. And if it means I never have to taste an envelope to seal it, I definitely would choose this one."
2117,"This is a nice pop-up note & pen holder. It has several very nice features.First, it uses 3M command adhesive tabs. These are great because they do not damage the wall when removed. Also the tabs are Velcro backed, so you can remove it to refill it without having to waste a tab.Second, the Pop-up note holder has a spring in it so it keep the pad flush against the opening so you can remove each piece of paper with ease.There is one aspect I do have a problem with, the pen holder. It is too wide to tightly hold a pen or even a sharpie marker. And it is so short, the pen will fall out if bumped or even when you pull out a piece of paper. I don't think the pen would do very well in a moving vehicle either.Overall, it is a nice product and can be placed where ever you need a pen & paper"
563,I like these file folder labels. I particularly like that there are 750 labels in a pack--that is very convenient and keeps me from constantly reordering the product.  I will look for more 3M office products.
563,"I am not a high energy person--why walk when you can ride, why stand when you can sit, etc.--but I have never found that it takes a lot of energy or talent to use a tape dispenser.  This little invention leaves me asking, Why?  What is so difficult about tearing off a piece of tape.  The grip feature doesn't work and you get 75 little pieces of tape?  If you are trying to survive in this economony like the rest of us, leave this little invention on the shelf, save your money, burn a calorie and simply use a standard tape dispenser. 3M is truly reaching to invent something that does not need inventing.  The quality is poor, the amount of cut tapes is poor.  i wouldn't bother with this one."
563,"I like the idea of the raffle ticket  with the tear away stubs being set up for an ink jet printer.  The card stock is a nice quality, and they offer the opportunity to really make the tickets exactly what you want.  Now here is the problem I have with it.  For $12.50 you get 20 sheets or potentially 10 tickets with stubs per page.  What kind of raffle does one have with only 200 tickets?  So for a decent size raffle, you might need 1000 tickets (or more) and using Avery's blanks and Amazon's price, it could cost $62.50 just for 1000 tickets - not including ink.  For under that price, you could purchase a swing arm paper cutter (prices start around $35-$40 on up) and light weight cardstock (Wausau 250 count for 11.99)  So for about the same price as 1000 Avery tickets, you have the potential to make 2500 tickets and cut them yourself.  And have the cutter for the next time.  And if you really need the tear off stub, you can run the tickets through a sewing machine with a medium needle and no thread to create a ""tear away"" stub.  A little bit of work but so many raffles are for charity so you want to keep as much money in the treasury as possible and it can be fun to make the tickets as a group.The product is a great idea but for a substantial raffle, I can see the price getting out of hand."
563,"This a one touch binder, meaning you press one lever and it opens. It does open very easily and maybe too easily. It seems likely to pop open. I know this is billed as an ultra duty binder (whatever that is supposed to mean) but I don't find it particularly stout.  They bill it as having their strongest cover. Mine came damaged on the spine--the plastic covering is very thin and torn at the corner. To be honest for the price $18, retail, less from Amazon, I do not find this binder worth the price. It wouldn't even hold up for school work."
563,"Love this labels.  Very bright colors, high quality.  I hope Post-It continues to do more of this kind of product."
563,"These are little paper envelopes with sticky tapes on the back that hold a very small amount of post-it notes.  The premise is that you can stick them to your laptop for convenience.  I suppose if you are on a flight with your laptop open and need a post-it note, this might make sense.  But, to me it has never been a burden to pull a post-it note off the stack to jot down my notes.  The envelopes are made from a cheap slick paper, and they only hold a small amount of post-its.  I simply don't get what 3M is trying to achieve with their latest do-nothing products.  Frankly, I will stick with my post-it note pad, pulling them off one at a time--I need the exercise.  I cannot recommend this product, the quality is poor and the reasoning behind the entire idea seems faulty to me."
563,"These little note tabs are perfect.  All of those scrappy bookmarks, twisted pieces of paper and old straw wrappers we use for marking frequented pages are a thing of the past.  These little tabs are perfect for marking all of those places without a mess.  They are also repositionable--and that to me means reusable.  Definitely recommend for your office or home."
563,"Like everyone in these hard economic times, I have tried to cut back and be more conscious of how I spend my money.  I have tried off brands, and I have tried to make do.  I always go back to Scotch brand.  The matte finish Scotch tape is virtually invisible, making it great for all kinds of projects.  The dispenser in the 3 pack is small and that makes it very kid-friendly for little hands.  I would highly recommend Scotch Magic Tape.  It's just better than anything else out there."
563,"These tabs are great.  They are particularly handy for teaching a class or making presentation.  They give you the tab for marking your place and also a clear transparent sheet to mark your place or highlight certain areas.  Great idea. My only complaint is that Avery puts too few of their products in a package.  There are 12 per pack here, 25 would be better because they are highly desirable for all kinds of marking and organizing."
563,"I love these repositionable tabs for organizing.  I work doing clincial billing and they are very useful in marking my place among client ledgers, or reminding me of something that needs doing next billing cycle.  My only complaint is that Avery puts too few of the product in a package.  20 per pack is handy, 40 would be better."
563,"Post-it has come out with a winner of a product here.  The labels are as advertised super sticky, but they do remove cleanly.  I work for a mental health center where privacy is paramount.  We cannot reuse folders if the labels are not cleanly removed.  This product allows us to remove the label cleanly and reuse the folder.  The product is very convenient and ""green."""
563,"I might be thinking of this a little early--but these would make great stocking stuffers for teenagers.  Get a pack of these, hand them to your teenager and let them decorate their room.  These are perfect for posters, hand drawn pictures etc.  On and off cleanly, no sticky residue.  I would recommend these for light weight hang ups.  Great product and reusable which means they are a good investment."
563,"3M makes good products and this is no exception.  But I find it difficult to use them as they are so tiny.  Mail people would need a magnifying glass to read the return address.  I also do not need 2000 labels at a time.  I like that Post-it and 3M put more than 100 labels in their packages but for my needs 2000 is way too many, I'll never use them all.  Good product quality, too small for my use and too many for my use."
563,It doesn't seem like a big thing--but peeling the strip off the self-seal envelopes can be a pain and those strips end up everywhere.  These are a nice quality envelope that closes so easily--very very handy.  Hopefully this idea will catch on to other products.I would recommend this product.
563,"This is as indicated on the front of the binder, indeed durable. I have been using these for some time for projects and they work very well and I will look for them again."
289,"I'm a writer and have TONS and TONS of papers, documents, binders, and books to keep track of on a daily basis.  These Avery NoteTabs are super easy to use and look so much better than my previous solution of Post It Note flags (or cut-to-size post-it notes).  The advantages of the NoteTabs are easy to list:1.  Bright and colorful; easy to find your marked pages.2.  Rigid construction; they have the perfect thickness, just like regular index tabs.  Rigid enough to stay parallel with your pages; no limping or bending problems.3.  Repositionable; you can change your mind on placement as you add more tabs, moving each on the page to the spot that's ""just right"" for easy reading.4.  See-through plastic-like material for the ""sticky"" part of the index tab.  This means you can actually read through the area where the index tab is temporarily ""glued"" (or, alternatively, even write a note on the see-through part that's stuck to the page, if you need to cite something specific).5.  If you reposition the tab, it's my experience that the ink is not lifted with the glue and no sticky residue remains on the page at all.6.  Easy to write on the index tab with either ballpoint or felt tip pens--no smudging!  No more guessing as to WHY I actually flagged the page--I can write it on the index tab for easy reference & use color coding, thanks to the variety of colors available.These are a real winner; highly recommended!"
289,"Well, just what CAN one say about a cardboard box? . . .Plenty!  These new moving boxes are ingenious. They are VERY sturdy and can handle quite a load.  Made of 65% recycled material, they're quick and easy to assemble, with no tape needed whatsoever.  This is a great timesaver, especially when packing for a move. Believe me, I know from firsthand experience how time consuming taping moving boxes together can be & these are designed to save you time.The boxes arrive in a large cardboard box, 10 bundled together flat with a single plastic strap.  Each box assembles in a snap:  just flip the flat box on its head, then pull the sides apart and you'll see the printed graphic assembly instructions printed on the bottom of the box (although the assembly process is so obvious, you really won't even need the instructions). Flaps are clearly numbered for ease of assembly.Just flip the box over (so it is ""right side up""), press down the bottom of the box and fold the reinforcing ""second bottom"" down.  Then it's a simple matter of separating the numbered, precut top sides and folding down, like any other box.  Once packed, you have one good, strong, box that will hold a surprising amount of material (books, cd's, etc.).Reinforcing tabs fold into the precut carrying handles and make carrying even a heavily packed box easy on the hands.  These reinforcing tabs also lock down the lid, so no tape is needed to seal the top of the box. Great timesaver!I'm using mine as Banker's Boxes to store both legal size and letter size files. Legal size file storage even has a little extra room, so it's even possible to store manila file folders nestled inside Pendaflex folders.  Most banker's boxes I've seen before are too small for this.All four sides of the box are printed with a ""Room"" and ""Contents"" area for easy labeling of the contents--you'll thank yourself after the move if you'll take the time to use these while you pack.Once used, these boxes are quick to re-fold for easy storage so you can reuse them as needed. Highly recommended!"
289,"Avery's perforated NoteTabs are an interesting hybrid office product:  a repositionable Index Tab wedded to custom-sizeable ""PostIt"" notes with an unusual twist:  they're transparent on the page.These perforated NoteTabs are really unique.  Each one is about 7-3/4 inches long and 3 inches wide.  Each individual NoteTab has a rigid, writeable index tab at the top with three, 2"" x 3"" perforated sections below.  You can either use the whole tab to mark a book, making notes as desired on the sections below OR you can separate a section at a time to use the 2""x3"" rectangular ""PostIts"" to mark pages or leave notes on documents for colleagues.Here's how I'm using mine:  I like to use the index tab separately to mark a page.  Then I tear off one 2""x3"" section of the tab to mark a part of the book and then use that part of the tab to underline the quote I'm after--it's great to not have to permanently deface a book and still be able to mark it up to my heart's content! Another use is to simply place a transparent ""PostIt"" over the passage of interest for easily locating it.The advantage over standard Post-Its it obvious:  since these are transparent, you can actually READ what's underneath your note--no need to move the note aside.They have the added advantage of being easily repositionable and reusable.  You can peel them off one page and move to another multiple times without (to my experience) lifting any ink or leaving behind any adhesive residue.Why 4 stars instead of 5?  I had a minor smudging issue with some of the ink I used on the transparent ""PostIt""--I recommend you use a ballpoint pen.  Otherwise, highly recommended!"
289,"These whiteboard markers come in gorgeous, bright colors with a nice fine point that makes your whiteboard writing much more legible than standard markers.  I have a set from the Board Dudes like these:Magnetic Markers Fun 6-Packthat LOOK the same on the outside, but the writing output of this Screamers set is MUCH superior--colors are brighter and much more vivid as they dry.Cap mounted erasers and magnetic caps make these convenient and ""unloseable.""  Highly recommended!"
289,"It's true:  this really is a quantum leap forward in Super Glue dispensers.It actually dispenses exactly one drop at a time, just when you need it, just where you need it.  No drips, no mistakes, no globbing. It's SIMPLE to use; just gently yet firmly squeeze the ""floating"" sides of the bottle's hard case and you can precisely dispense a drop at a time (which, for me, is a huge leap forward for liquid Super Glue).One bottle has twice the Super Glue of a standard .07 ounce tube of conventional Super Glue and the cap screws on easily and fits tightly; I think this Super Glue will last a lot longer than an equivalent amount of tubed glue, simply because there's no waste whatsoever.The bottle is self-puncturing; just be sure to screw the top on very tightly the first time you use it, or the seal won't be properly punctured (and no glue will come out). Highly recommended for its ease of use."
289,"As a writer, I have a blizzard of papers, documents, binders, and books to keep track of on a daily basis.  Avery's NoteTabs are a PERFECT solution to my problem.  They are super easy to use and look so much better than my previous solution of Post It Note flags (or cut-to-size post-it notes).I like these light pastel colors for ongoing projects, because the colors aren't distracting. Brighter colors are great for flagging important pages, but these pastels fade nicely into the background so that your handwritten label ""stands out,"" not the NoteTab itself.In a nutshell, here's a quick list of NoteTabs' advantages:1. Rigid construction; they have the perfect thickness, just like regular index tabs. Rigid enough to stay parallel with your pages; no limping or bending problems.2. Repositionable; you can change your mind on placement as you add more tabs, moving each on the page to the spot that's ""just right"" for easy reading.3.

289,"I'm a freelance writer who deals with a blizzard of paperwork, books, manuals, and notes on a daily basis.  And since a lot of my writing is of a technical nature, I need to refer back to read items quickly and efficiently.  In the past, I used a combination of Post-it Flags and custom-cut Post-it notes, as well as low-tech bookmarks with scrawled notes.  Glue-on (or stick on) Index Tabs just wouldn't work for me--too permanent and too bulky.These Note Tabs from Avery are a terrific all-around solution:  they're repositionable, can be written on with just about any kind of pen, have a see-through adhesive section that not only lets you read text through them, but can be written on, as well, if you need to make a quick note in the margin of your book or document.The tabs that protrude out from the page are also nicely rigid, not floppy (like typical Post-its or flags).  There is plenty of writing room on the tab itself for quick referencing of marked pages, and I really like the fact that they can be repositioned on the page to accomodate the placement of other tabs as my project progresses.  The colors are nice and bright.  Would be wonderful for marking a cookbook! These rounded tabs take up less space (outside the page) than Avery's conventionally-shaped index-style NoteTabsAvery NoteTabs, 2 x 1.5 Inches, Neon Blue and Magenta, 40 per pack (16293).A real winner; highly recommended!"
289,"I love these labels!  They are super easy to use, unlike other brands I have purchased in the past.  They also deliver the quality adhesive strength 3M is famous for.I have a wireless laser network printer that I've never configured for label printing.  After I received these file folder labels, I visited 3M's website (as per package instructions), clicked on the ""Template"" tab, entered the product # (3300-H) and downloaded the appropriate template.  The whole process took less than 2 minutes from start to finish.The template was automatically loaded into Word.  It was a simple process to customize my text (Tahoma, 14 point, centered) and I printed a sheetfull in no time; no feed problems, no alignment problems, no headaches.The feed direction is clearly printed on the sheet, but it looks like the labels would print properly, even if fed in backwards.  My labels were perfectly aligned and centered and there was absolutely ZERO smudging when I applied them to the file folders.  Label edges are neatly perforated, so separating the label from its backing is a simple matter of slightly bending the sheet for easy label removal.  No ""feel n peel"" required!Personally, I prefer plain labels like these for filing (not the color coded, bar-stripped type my local office supply carries).  I find they're much easier to visually scan when searching for files, but that may just be me.  These labels look clean and crisp and the edges are adhered firmly to the folder tab.  Paper is a soft matte, so there's a good contrast between the printed text and the label AND there's no shiny paper look to interfere with the clarity of your printed ink.These are high quality file folder labels; highly recommended!"
289,"I have a whiteboard memopad that was destined for the garbage dump before finding these erasers.I'd tried EVERYTHING to get rid of ghosting and leftover remnants of orange, pink, and purple ink on my whiteboard.  Erasers, Windex, paper towels, soft cloths, white vinegar and water--nothing worked.  Until now.These erasers completely removed any remnant of the old ink I could not get rid of AND they helped bring a shine back to the whiteboard's finish, which had become dull and grayish.  All in about one minute of rubbing.  I did not need to use any water (although you can, the label says, if needed).The white side is for erasing, the blue side's just for gripping.  They do the job & do it well; highly recommended."
289,"Post-it Notes are undeniably a terrific organizing tool.But Post-it Notes for a laptop? Unfortunately, they just didn't prove themselves to be a practical organizing solution for me.The dispenser is designed to adhere to your laptop (NOT the screen) with two strips of adhesive and holds just 20 notes.  Although marketed as ""refillable,"" you actually have to refill the dispenser from the bottom, which means you have to unstick it from whatever you've stuck it to and then refill it and re-stick it.  Not very practical.They just aren't needed for a laptop; I, like most computer users, make all my notes on a desktop version of post-it notesPost-it Software Noteswhen I'm on my laptop, not on pieces of paper.I really can't even see the point of it for a laptop-based office receptionist working for a group of salesmen; she'll run out of notes on a daily basis & they have to be applied to the BACK of the laptop, which isn't very ergonomic.I've racked my brain & the only practical use I can find for these is as a refrigerator-mounted message center for the family on the go.  If 3M will re-market this as a Fridge Message Center, it may work.  But this is just an impractical no-go for laptop users.  Reboot!"
289,"I'm a freelance writer & I've modified conventional post-it notes for YEARS for marking up drafts, flagging passages, and creating quick bookmarks & notes.This latest iteration of the vaunted Post-It Note line is GREAT--you can quickly mark a page or flag a passage on a manuscript in a flash, using ""just the right size"" note to contain your writing.  It's sticky all over, so the whole note sticks to paper perfectly & won't fall off or get lost, no matter how many pairs of hands it passes through.So far, my favorite use for this is domestic--it's PERFECT for dating and labeling food and leftovers in the fridge.  I use just a postage-stamp size bit of this on top of my containers & at the end of the week, what's not been used & is ""out of date"" goes into the garbage--no more unintended Biology Projects mouldering unseen in the back corners of the middle shelves!The design is smart--just press the edge of the tape onto whatever you're marking, unroll to size, then use a flick of your wrist to tear a neat edge with the dispenser (similar to Scotch tape).Great simple tool for office & home--a winner!"
289,"These are nice manila folders, although they are the ""modern"" definition of letter size (which means you'll see about 1/64th of an inch of paper on the top edge of the stowed file and a very tiny tad of the corners of your filed paper under the notched corners of the file).**Sigh**This, unfortunately, is an issue that ALL the recently manufactured manila folders I've bought seem to have, so I've learned to say ""c'est la vie.""**Sigh**Get past that little issue, and you'll find a filing folder that SCREAMS organization.I'm a visual organizer & love using these nicely bright primary colors of bright red, bright yellow, green, & blue.Made of partially recycled material, these have nice rigidity & a large label area.I label the top tabs only; although you can definitely add info under the cutout area, it will always be covered whenever your papers are in the file (if you're filing 8-1/2 x 11 papers, that is).These definitely add a little personality to your filing system; I like mine!P.S.  Made in the U.S.A.!"
1543,"The kids in our house are tape-crazy, so I buy a lot of it, usually in bulk. They use it for art projects, for taping their pictures to windows, etc. I have on occassion bought the cheaper tape, the kind labeled with the name of big department stores like Target. Let me say emphatically - it's not worth it! It never comes off as easily because the gum on the tape comes off on whatever you put it on. I never have to worry about that with Scotch Tape."
1543,"I received this package and it included 6 of each, blue and green. They are basically flexible, see-through plastic with a tab on one end that has adhesive on one side, and can be placed and replaced on various types of paper. These would be ideal for students who want to write notes in their textbooks without making a mark, as the plastic tabs are completely removable. They are also perforated in 4 places, so you can adjust them accordingly. You can write on them with various types of writing implements."
1543,"My kids are of the age where it's fun when I say ""Let's do a craft!"" so I have a box of random things like glue, string, paper, scissors, etc. for them to make things out of. When they saw this they immediately wanted to know how to use it, and caught on very quickly. I also use this for attaching pictures into their memory books. So I would say I like this product because it's easy to use and versatile, a nice gadget to have around the house."
1543,"These are super easy to use, both in the printer and as just regular labels around the house. They stick great, but more importantly they are easy to remove. I love that you can just bend the sheet and they all sort of 'pop up'. Definitely recommend these over the standard labels we have all been using for years....they have finally made them easier to use."
1543,"I am pretty sensitive to strong smelling markers, so I was please when these arrived and didn't have an overpowering smell.  I have used them on a dry erase easel, and they work fine.  I like the unique shape that prevents it from rolling off the table.  Not an issue for what I am using them for, but I can see that being a helpful feature.  I haven't used it long enough for the ink to run out, but I do like that I'll be able to see through the outside cover to see if it's running low.  Not washable, so be sure to keep away from kids."
1543,"I love this idea! Precut pieces, 2"" in length, and easy to lift off.So this particular package comes with two desk dispensers and 2 wrist dispensers. The wrist ones need loading with one of the 6 refills included, the desk ones come preloaded. Note: the desk dispensers say they are not able to be reloaded, though they seem like they would be able to.I gave the wrist dispensers to my kids for their craft boxes, and they love it! No more fussing about how the tape won't cut properly, and no more me worrying about their fingers getting cut on the sharp part. Yes, it runs out, but I have a few refills to tide me over for now.The desk dispensers are cool because they don't need adhesive to stay on. Just put them on the desk, and the very light suction cup action works as you pull straight up on the tape. A cool concept.Overall, a great product!"
1543,"I used these in my printer to get my return address and logo pre-printed on them. The ink worked well, no smudges, and there was no trouble feeding them to the printer. I like the added security feature of this envelope, good for sending checks or private letters."
1543,"So these work just fine, have 2 rip-off strips on the back that are supposed to attach to the top of your laptop. I have not done this as I have no intention on ever slapping anything on my computer that might never come off. What I did use them on is my kid's craft box, and they stayed there ok. My only ""con"" here is....what is the purpose? It just seems like a waste. Maybe for people who are so on-the-go they need sticky notes right there at all times, for me I can stand to walk over to my counter and rip one off to make a note. I don't need a special dispenser that will likely go into the landfill at some point."
1543,"I really do like this.  But I have not found a magnetic surface in my house that holds it well.  Sticking it to the wall is my only option, which works great for me so no issues there."
1543,"These come in bright green and bright pink color, with a perforated edge that I THINK is supposed to make it easier to peel one off. Only problem is: it doesn't. I like the writing surface, but they are so difficult to peel that I am more likely to use my pop-up dispenser than these."
1543,"These are great, and priced right too. What I like best is the ease in which they can be removed from the sheet, no bending the labels next to the one you want to remove just to get it off the page. They are thin sheets that didn't get stuck in my Canon printer. And they stick super strong. All in all, I'd buy these again."
1224,"Great pen that reminded me why rollerball pens are such an improvement over ballpoint. The ink flows beautifully. Pen has nice weight, matte finish, comes in a great little black box with elastic band. It would make for a great gift to anyone who loves a great writing instrument. The snake wrap-around also provides a nice accent."
1224,These are much better than the thin rectangular flags I'm used too. The half circle shape and thicker product resists crumpling and tearing. Works great and lasts longer!
1224,"I love the one touch opener and the D ring design with pins and sockets that make ripping the holes when turning pages a thing of the past. Those are the key pluses. The binder holds more for its size and is a pleasure to use.I also like the four (or 2+ extra access) internal pockets. However, I had just started using the binder when one of the pockets began to bubble and looks like it might tear soon. The cover is also bubbling in several places. If you don't mind the bubbles, it is a great binder."
1224,"3M has come up with another winner. These labels are basically Post-it notes but with weak sticky stuff covering one whole side, not just the top of the note. They are very quick and handy for labeling bins, boxes, large binders etc.My only ""gripe"" is the way they peel off. On one edge there is no glue on the back so that you can easily separate the label from the pad. There's a black dotted line, with a perforation towards the inside (so that the dotted line is outside the label). They've done a great job of keeping the perforation fine, so that you can barely tell it from the other sides once used as a label. However, it should be just a little easier to tear without wrinkling the label. This is no big deal but renders the label slightly less user friendly than a Post-it note, which can  be grabbed off in one swift motion."
1224,"This roll is something like a cross between masking tape and Post-it notes. You can write on it better than masking tape and it adheres more firmly than Post-it notes but can still be removed fairly easily. Makes a handy label but if you want it neat, keep your scissors handy. Great for the workshop as is."
1224,"I'm constantly writing articles. These Avery NoteTabs are great for marking pages in books.  Nice and stiff, so they don't wimp out. Brightly colored, so you can spot them.  Also great that you can write a note on them and erase for reuse. So, for example, I might write something like Monks1 to indicate this marks the first of several quotes of Robert Monks. Very helpful, if you have a lot of references and can use a simple manual system, rather than scanning into a database."
1224,These are the quickest boxes I've used for setup. The size is great for lots of items but probably not books or paper. Also breaks down easily for storage before reuse. Can't be beat.
1224,"Great set of tabs. I recently used them in marking and organizing a book for review. They can be handled over and over again without tearing and they are wide, so won't get lost or tear book page. Four colors allowed the use of categories. The only drawback I see is the warning on the package that says ""adhesive may mark some surfaces or lift ink. Test before using."" I haven't used them extensively yet, so haven't run into that problem... although they do feel stickier than a regular Post-it note. In most cases that should be a plus."
1224,"Ouch! I was just about to sit down to write a rave review. The product had been performing as advertised (dropper applicator worked fine and cap wasn't getting stuck). However, when I just now picked it up to give the bottle another glance, glue spilled all over a small portion of my fancy new dining room table and on my laptop. I wiped up most of it with a paper towel, which is now stuck to my thumb and several fingers. Unfortunately, we did't have any acetone in the house. (might want to have some on standby if you're going to use this product!)The glue leaked out the side of the bottle... around one of the seams of the magic ""button"" on both sides that gives you that precision one drop at a time. I'm sure it was a fluke... a bad bottle, but given the fact that my table now has a big smudge mark of super glue on it, the return key on my MacBook has a low rise crater and my thumb and fingers are hurting from the pain... I can't recommend it, although I'm not selling my 3M stock... at least not yet.One recommendation, keep the bottle upright when not in use and don't squeeze the sides until you're ready to use the dropper."
1224,"I'm probably decades behind the rest of the world. When I was working in an office my secretary used to do this stuff. Anyway, two minutes out of the box, I downloaded a template and was printing nice, neat, easily read labels that stick securely but are removable... so I can still reuse those old folders. No problem using the Mac or printing a few at a time and refeeding later for the rest of the page. Simplicity. What's not to like?"
1224,"Very handy for sticking paper or other light objects to refrigerators, walls and windows... and you can actually rinse off and reinvigorate when they start to lose their stickiness. It is like having a little square of glue from a million post-it notes. I've taken some of the clutter off my desk and moved it to a wall where I can organize notes easier. On the refrigerator, I don't have to look at magnets. I even stuck a couple with paper on a window to keeps bird crashes down!Two minor negatives: 1. pulling off protective film takes a microsecond longer than it should (if they could space the actual glue blocks slightly apart, they would be easier to get to). 2. I don't care for the smell (not a problem unless you have your nose within a couple of inches of the product).I doubt I'll be a heavy user, but I think 3M has another great niche product with these reusable tabs. I keep a pack handy in the kitchen and office."
1224,"I love the pocket feature... great for keeping in all those bills and odd sized slips of paper and makes it easy to stand upright outside the file cabinet. Made with heavy stock, so looks like it should holde up. However, unlike some other files, this one is not reinforce with plastic coating at top and bottom... that's the one improvement I would make.I also like the fact that the pockets are made with paper certified under the Sustainable Forestry Initiative and that they contain at least 10% recycled material."
1224,"Who knew there were still innovations out there for the rather plain security business envelope? The big innovation here is that not only is there no need to lick, there's no bothersome strip to dispose of either. You simply fold up a flap with a slightly waxy strip on it that keeps the envelope from sealing itself before you are ready. Fold up the small flap to ""reveal"" the glue; fold down the larger flap to ""seal"" in your contents. It is very simple and it works! Who could ask for more?"
1344,"I've been a long-time lover of fountain pens, but the often prohibitive pricing of the higher priced pens out there, or the just-not-good-enough quality of the budget-priced ones, pretty much brought my fountain pen shopping to a standstill a few years ago.I have to say that I was quite surprised to see that Pilot has stepped up to the plate with fountain pen offerings here in their MR Animal Collection line. I was even more surprised when I opened the very nicely made box that presents this budget-priced pen so well! The packaging is as nice as what I've received my more expensive (but still low-priced, in a $50 - $75 range) Waterman pens in, and the pen contained within is really quite lovely! I wouldn't say that its color is anything like a gold, as advertised, but it is quite close to the color pictured (about as close as one can expect going by the images displayed by a basic computer monitor). Overall, it's a lovely pen, and the lizard print accent enhances it, making it look more expensive, as opposed to cheap.The nib here writes just as well as any of my Mont Blanc or Waterman pens do, although I do have to admit to being partial to fine points, so my experience writing with a medium point is limited. One thing that has really taken me by surprise here is the converter! I'm used to the cumbersome, twist-to-fill converters that have come with every other fountain pen that I've ever owned, and this simple, squeeze-to-fill converter is really innovative! I'm kind of enchanted by it, really, and amazed that no other manufacturer (that I've encountered) ever thought to put something like this out! If it holds up well over time, it just might be a game-changer!The one thing that I didn't appreciate here was that my pen came with no information whatsoever. No warranty information, no instructions on refill model numbers, no contact information to purchase extra parts via, and worst of all if anyone new to fountain pens buys one of these and gets no insert - no information on how to fill the converter! I'm assuming that because my pen came to me in a different manner than most others looking at this will get theirs, perhaps that's why there was no enclosed information, but for anyone not sure of how to fill it with the converter, here's how:1. With the converter still attached to the nib - as it arrives packaged - squeeze the end of the converter where the metal tongue compresses the rubber ink chamber. Hold tongue in place, to ensure as much air as possible is squeezed out.2. Submerge the pen nib in a bottle of ink intended specifically for fountain pens.3. Release the tongue to fill.4. Wipe off the nib, and you're ready to write!Overall, for the presentation here and the pen itself, this is a REALLY great offering for less than twenty bucks! This is the sort of pen that allows anyone to walk around looking just a little more elegant in their workspace or home office, without having to worry about the exorbitant cost to replace this fountain pen if misplaced! Fountain pens add a touch of elegance to everything office-related, I think, and now having one like this available - made by Pilot, and at such a fair price - puts that extra touch within everyone's reach!"
1344,"... like those associated with writing reviews for great products, like this wrist rest! ; )My computer desk at home has a pull-out keyboard shelf for my desktop system, and this wrist rest fits perfectly between the shelf and the keyboard itself. The shelf is just wide enough to allow for the width of the keyboard and this wrist rest, making my computer desk's presentation look that much more put-together and elegant. And the wrist rest itself couldn't be more comfortable, providing just the right amount of firmness and support with enough soft ""give"" to make typing with my wrists resting on it SO much more comfortable an experience!Honestly, I had no idea that I needed one of these, and now that I have it, I LOVE it! It looks polished and elegant with the leatherette surface, it's super comfortable, and, at 3/4"" high x just under 3"" wide, and 19 inches long, it's a great size for just about any standard keyboard out there. The antimicrobial feature, the packaging states, reduces microbes that would cause damage and deterioration to this wrist rest, so you also can feel reassured that this 3M product will be around for years of enjoyment and support!Whether you use it in your home or work office, this 3M wrist rest will look elegant and bring comfort to your computing surface. And, at less than $20, with an antimicrobial surface as an added bonus, you really can't go wrong. I always worried about developing carpal tunnel syndrome; now, having this under my wrists while typing, I worry about it far less than I used to. DEFINITELY a good buy!"
1344,"Scotch tape is a staple in my home. Yes, I can find cheaper tape at my local Dollar store, but as always, you get what you pay for, and the cheaper tape's adhesive never fails to eventually peel away and stop sticking. Not such a problem with 3M's Scotch tape.Scotch Magic Tape is great for wrapping gifts with matte finish wrap, as it virtually becomes invisible on it. Glossy wrapping papers, however, will evidence the presence of Scotch brand's magic tape in the absence of sheen where the tape has been placed. If you're not overly particular with regards to this sort of stuff, you'll do fine with it. The 3/4 inch width is also a nice, wide tape for average, every day use. I tend to use Scotch tape a lot in lieu of those kitchen clip things to close up opened packages. Fold over a little tab at the end of a long strip of tape, wrap half of it on one side of the opening, stick it to the opposite side of the bag/packaging, and you're good to go. It even holds in the freezer. Who needs a clip, anyway?The one thing that turns me off about this package of Scotch tape is the misleading product packaging. The rolls are made to appear as if they have more tape on them than they actually do. I'd honestly rather pay more for three FULL rolls of tape, than pay just over a buck and a quarter (on Amazon; more at your local retail store) for a roll of tape that's really only half full, as the base of the roll of tape is just filler plastic. Not just misleading, but wasteful and environmentally unfriendly, too! It's a Scotch brand BOGO! And NOT the kind you really want!Overall, Scotch tape works well for what it's supposed to do. It's tape - it SHOULD work well! But the fact that 3M misleads its customers by sticking a big throwaway empty plastic core onto each of these cheapie dispensers costs them (reputation-wise), in my book. If you need this tape, this is the place to get it at a good price (especially if you've got an Amazon Prime membership). But if you don't need one roll for the car, one for the office, and one for home, I think you're better off looking for a fuller single roll of tape than going with what Scotch offers here."
1344,"When I first opened up my Scotch Adhesive Dot Roller, I noticed how cleverly made the case is that holds the adhesive dot refills. It very much reminded me of those correction tape dispensers of old (something that some of you may never have laid eyes on...).The case is very comfortable in the hand, ergonomically speaking, and the raised dot pattern on the top side was designed (successfully, IMHO) to provide a comfortable finger grip. I like that the cover for the adhesive dot-containing tape snaps in place, whether open while in use, or closed when this is being stored. Switching out the refill has also been made very easy by a small push ""button"" at the top of the unit. Once you've opened the side (which is wisely hinged to the other half of the case), it's simply a matter of popping the old refill out, and the new one in.Now, as for the adhesive dots themselves, they'd be great for scrapbooking and sticking photos where you want them, as long as you're looking for secure (but not permanent) adhesion of lightweight things (paper, cardstock, foils, but no felt or heavier weight fabrics, and nothing very thick) to other lightweight things. To me, their adhesion level is somewhere between what you'd get from a thin layer of a standard office supply glue stick and double-sided tape. Being an Art teacher working at the Elementary level, I can't see myself using this to adhere heavy weight paper to mat boards, or anything that needs a good, strong, relatively permanent bond. I'll stick with Elmer's white glue for that. But for the scrapbookers out there, or those of you into keeping lots of photo albums, the mobility that you'll get with the dots will be right up your alley, as this is really a very easy little tool to use, and its ergonomic shape will keep it comfortable in your hands for longer periods of adhesive application.With this Scotch product, you pretty much get what you expect. The adhesive dots are low-profile, so as I mentioned above, you're not going to get these to hold anything terribly heavy weight or thick, but for standard paper use and scrapbooking needs, I can't imagine that you wouldn't find this tool to be handy when you need to apply an adhesive. There are other products out there that will offer you a stronger adhesive hold if you need one, but they're also undoubtedly much messier to use, and will very likely offer more frustration over long jobs than Scotch's Adhesive Dot Roller will. This product is definitely worth trying out. It may be just what you're looking for!"
1344,"These Scotch brand reusable sticky tabs work great for hanging posters and similar paper items that have a somewhat plasticized surface. They're strong enough to hold those items to just about any standard wall surface (save stucco-type surfaces) with no damage to the plasticized product being hung, or the wall surface that said item is being adhered to. The stickiness of the tabs even came back after I washed them with soap and water and stuck a tiny corner to my printer to allow them to air dry - something I didn't think would actually work, but it does!I also tried using these to hang a lightweight fabric hanging (single layer of woven cloth, no backing or lining to weigh it down). As you can imagine, they didn't work so well with that, unquestionably due to the way the fibers adhered to the surface of these sticky tabs. The stickiness can obviously only go so far, and weavings are beyond these tabs' adhesion capabilities.Overall, these are a great alternative to simple tape or those double-sided sticky foam squares which leave a mess all over your walls. These Scotch tabs will stick to the surfaces that you want them to, and peel away cleanly when you're ready to swap out those posters. I loved that the stickiness actually DOES come back post-washing! And they're crystal clear, which I also liked, as well.Scotch gives us another great product to use around the house! Good stuff!"
1344,"These Avery labels work as you'd expect them to, and are great for labeling more than just items you might want to mail. Write on a label, peel it off, stick it to what you want labeled. The adhesive layer on the back of each label is light, but continuous, so they don't act like label flags. The colors are pleasant and neutral, even though I would've preferred a soft orange or red hue, as opposed to the avocado colored labels at the top of the ""pad"". Handy, helpful, and easy to use. They're worth picking up."
1344,"Quartet offers a product that's easily as competitive as Expo and other well-known dry erase markers out there, when it comes to looking for a quality dry erase marker! Unlike other brands, Quartet is also not afraid to show you what you're working with, and how much you have left - those clear windows on the shaft of each marker are invaluable for you staying up to date on when it's time to buy more markers!The colors here are also bright and vibrant, and while each marker in this 12 pack is not a different color from the others in the package, you still have quite a few colors to choose from. In my pack I did have two of the same shade of red, and two black markers - because Quartet didn't bother to try to mix things up a bit with providing a wide range of varied colors, I thought it was fair to take this pack down by a star, but even still, that may be a little harsh on my side - the oversight here is probably only half-star-penalty-worthy, but, that's not an option, so...With the caps that prevent these markers from rolling away (like EVERY other dry erase marker out there), and the windows that show how much ink is left, Quartet has beat out its competitors with some smart features here. All they need to do now is expand on the color range enclosed in this pack, and they'll have an unquestionably five star product!"
1344,"First off, I love the great, bright colors that these labels come in. I'm not the most organized person in the world, but the colors on these will definitely make them hard to miss. There are plenty of labels in the package, although I DO wish there were more of the blue ones, as the yellow and limeade are pretty similar in color in my opinion, and I just happen to like the blue ones best in the pack.Another nice feature is the adhesive that Post-it has used on these labels. They hold well onto the surfaces that you stick them to (especially anything that's plasticky), and they remove easily, and cleanly. I'm really not inclined to remove and reposition most labels once I've put them on something, but it's nice to know that that's at least a viable option with these.As labels go, these are pretty thoughtfully made! I do still find myself puzzled by just how pricey labels often are, but comparatively speaking, you'll get more of your money's worth out of the ability to move these around. Pretty good stuff!"
1344,"I was so excited to try out these Avery mailing labels (I know, but I'm relatively easy to please!), and they're just what I was hoping they'd be!The sheets contained within the standard Avery pouch contain two large mailing labels per page. As others have mentioned, when you're using online shippers, oftentimes they give you a page to route through your printer that would waste the top portion of these label sheets on a receipt. Since the back of each label page suggests that you try printing out your label on a standard blank sheet of paper to ensure that it looks right when printed, I followed that suggestion, and then taped the upper half of the page (containing the receipt) to the top of my Avery mailing label page, and oriented it properly to get the label printed on the bottom. The only problem with that was that the right-hand border of the postage label itself got cut off due to orientation.Realizing that it was my printer setup that was causing the problem and waste, I re-adjusted what would print by using my browser page's ""Print Preview"" function, changing the settings so that none of the standard Margin & Footer information would print out on the page (URL, page #, date & time stamp, etc). Following that, I changed the actual margins to a much deeper top margin (1.25""), and much more shallow (0.1"") bottom margin. After that, I taped the upper half of that initial test sheet to the top of my label sheet, printed my label and, problem solved! My emailed return labels from companies now print out exactly where I want them to, and thanks to these labels, I don't have to sweat taping them down to within an inch of anything's life!These labels are just as sticky as the standard ones used by UPS, which I've always been happy to find adhere well enough to the parcel to keep it in place securely while it travels to me, but not so sticky that I'm unable to cleanly remove the label once I've received my parcel and want to re-use the box.Overall, once you've figured out exactly how you want your mailing labels oriented and have made the necessary adjustments to get them there, these labels are going to make your mailing tasks SO much easier. I really and truly feel like my parcels look completely professional with these labels, as opposed to the standard, taped-down, homespun ""labels"" that I'd used before. These are well worth the price you'll pay for them (on average, around a quarter per label) for the convenience and professional look that they'll bring to your mailing tasks. Another great, very convenient and helpful product from Avery for the at-home business person!"
1344,"I received my popup tape handband dispenser after the winter wrapping insanity had ended, but still find that it's very helpful for quick jobs requiring average length tape strips.The 3/4"" width and 2"" length of these strips is a good, general size for just about any of your average tasks, and I also like the fact that the tape itself seems to be just a bit thicker (or at least sturdier), than the average roll tape. The elastic band on the back of the dispenser makes it very easy to slide over your fingers and onto the back of your hand or to your wrist, but I find that, more often than not, removing the dispenser from my wrist ends up pulling the elastic out of the tabs meant to secure it to the underside of the dispenser. A minor annoyance, but still...Overall, I believe that this tape dispenser will prove to be as helpful as you're hoping it will be. It's great to have if you're in the midst of a taping job that requires that you keep one hand on whatever you're taping, and only have two fingers to spare to quickly pull a strip of tape off to secure the item you're working on. And, at around $.66 per refill (IF you buy 'em in a 12 pack -Scotch Pop-Up Tape Strips 90M-12PK), really, it's fairly priced for the convenience this tape dispenser offers.Pretty good product, all things considered!"
1344,"Avery is always offering up helpful products at great prices, and these page markers are no different! The variety of colors make it easy to color code what pages refer to what (once you've made up your own chart), and the adhesive on them is strong enough to allow you to turn a page or two over them to get to the marked page, while not damaging the pages upon removal of the tabs. If you keep your pages clean, these can even be repositioned, but to a limit.I've got a music therapist friend who teaches piano to special needs children, and she told me that she LOVES these, and has gone through hundreds of packs of them over her years of teaching. Since many of her special needs students are better able to follow color as opposed to letters, she uses these markers on the keys needed to learn a musical piece. Avery's page markers are the perfect size for piano keys, and the adhesive doesn't damage the finish.I have yet to find an Avery product that I've tried that hasn't proved to do a great job for what it was designed for, and I've often found that they work great in unexpected situations, too!"
1101,"I looked forward to using these for moving and temporarily storing prized china dishes downstairs while we renovate the dining room. Although they aren't moving far, they still need to be packed for any long move.  The box was reinforced enough to make it not seem like breaking apart with just a little weight.  I liked the handles on the unit as it made carrying what would otherwise be an awkward size to handle.  Most impressed with how the boxes quickly fold back down once you're done so you can reuse these in the future by conveniently storing them in the closet."
1101,"These work better than the original trademarked 3M product because of the additional adhesiveness underneath.  Else, the quality is about the same.  For this reason, if you use these to affix to where a page wont press down on it (i.e. top of paper) then get these instead."
1101,"Not really as soft as I would have liked it.  Because of this, it's too high for my apple keyboard. Good quality construction though."
1101,Good high quality tabs.  Wont break easily.  Looks nice and stands out boldy when applied to the folder.  What more can you ask for?
1101,Been using these a few weeks and so far and happy with them.  Less pricey than the competition but just as functional. Color coding helps with separating folders visually.  Time will tell if the hangers are reinforced enough to support heavier files but so far so good.
1101,Good labels.  Sticks well and wont peel off over time as may some of the other generic brands.  I put these on older ragged folders too (we recycle folders for years) and they didn't have any problem sticking.
1101,"The pad is very attractive looking on a desk and hefty enough that it doesn't squirm away when writing on.  The feature here is you can access all the colors without having to break apart the ""cubes"" as in 3M's brand. However, you can still only write on the very top which is probably going to be the orange color.  If you want the lower colors they need to be torn off.  The perforations were easy enough to tear apart."
1101,"These are terrific high quality sticker labels.  There's a nice smell to them and they stick so well.  The colors are bold so they stand out to ensure your eyes point directly at them when trying to find the print you need.  I don't even bother using a printer, just hand print to stick on binders, folders, and such, all buried in a heap of other similar kind.  Don't hesitate to buy!"
1101,Nice idea but the holder is rather clunky and doesn't dispense the post-it notes as well as it should.  I eventually just tossed it out and used the post-its raw.
1101,Good labels.  Have used generic ones and they always just don't last.. peels off after time but these Averys wont do that.  Important in this case since you don't want your shipping label peeling off in mid transit.  Spend the extra money and get the quality you need. One lost package will cost you a lot more.
1101,"I pack this in my carry case when making business calls.  Regular scotch tape is bulky and gets dust trapped underneath the exposed area.  No such problems with this unit.  Tape is thick and high quality.Only con is that these are expensive for the size, so if you use scotch tape up a lot in the same place you probably should get the regular kind."
1101,"These folders are built well and are colorful.  Most important trait is of course, for them to be sturdy and hold up over time.  Can't evaluate that yet.  But overall, they appear to be of high quality."
721,"When I first opened this pen up, I was immediately impressed with the style, quality feel, and the smooth writing.As a programmer, I spend all day in front of a computer; but, I think better when I write things out in a notepad on my desk - so I do a lot of writing.Anyway, even with the positive first impression, I found this pen wasn't suited to heavy use.  The twist mechanism started coming apart after just a couple of days - and the point doesn't always come out correctly.  It's hard to explain since the pen doesn't appear to be broken, but the twist mechanism just didn't hold up very well.I've also found that, although this pen definitely performs better than a cheap ballpoint, I've used quite a few pens that write better as well.Overall, if you're looking for a stylish pen for light usage, I think this pen is probably a perfect choice.  If, like me, you use a pen all day long - I'd probably pass on this and look elsewhere."
721,"With my business, we sell products and then have to store them up to 4 months, due to federal regulations, before they can be delivered.  Because of that, I typically use sticky notes for quick identification of which product goes with which order.Anyway, when I saw these double sticky notes I was extremely excited.  I thought ""No more sticky notes constantantly wanting to come off!"".The problem is that they aren't as cool as I thought.  The adhesive on the top edge isn't that strong so I get sticky notes that flip up on both the top and bottom rather than just the bottom...The design itself is excellent if it weren't for the adhesion problem.  There is glue on the top edge like a normal sticky and there is another strip about an inch from the bottom.  That space at the bottom lets you easily grab a new sticky from the pad - and it would hold the entire note in position with stronger glue.Oh well, maybe they'll come out with a version 2 that has a stronger adhesive.  If so, I'll be first in line to pick some up!"
721,"We have a small business and deal with a lot of government documents that we have to keep handy when out of the office.  What we typically do is to shrink them down to half size and then have them laminated - which is where this little unit comes in handy!The laminator was easy to setup and is very easy to use once it's warmed up.  The output quality seems just as good as the lamination we were having done at OfficeMax - and it's much more convenient.Overall, I would highly recommend this if you're looking for a low volume machine to take care of your own laminations - either at home or in a small office."
721,"We deal with a lot of federal documents; and, in many cases, we end up making permanent copies to keep with us as records.  For those copies, we typically laminate them so they'll last longer - and these laminating pouches have worked very well.Overall, these are easy to use and seal completely in our little Swingline lamination machine.I would highly recommend them."
721,"As a C/C++ programmer, I tend to fill notebooks with debug notes as I work.  I've always preferred using a pencil since it's easier to fix mistakes, but I never thought there was much difference between the quality of the pencils I've used - until this one.  This little guy is very comfortable to hold and the pencil lead is always sharp.Now I just need to remember to keep it hidden when I'm not around!  :)"
721,"These labels have been great for organizing not only folders, but storage bins that I have where the contents tend to change occasionally. The stick on great and stay in place until you want to remove them - at which point they come off cleanly. There isn't too much more that I could want from these."
721,"This is one of those things that someone should have thought of years ago.  These retractable highlighters are far more convenient than the traditional caps.  Most of the colors are nice and bright, although there are a couple that seem a bit too dark to use as highlighters.Now I need to go get a set of retractable permanent markers!"
721,"These labels are absolutely perfect for labeling reloaded ammo boxes.  I basically run them through my laser printer to print a basic template that includes: date, bullet, bullet weight, over-all length, powder, and powder charge.  Then, after I finish with a reloading session, I just use a pen to fill in the blanks and then stick a label onto each box.Aside from being extremely convenient, it's also nice that these are color-coded and removeable.  I can easily apply different colors to different loads so I can tell at a glance what is in the box.  After I empty each box, I just peel the sticker off and the box is ready to go again with no sticky residue.I realize that this specific use probably isn't interesting to everyone, but it seems like these labels could be applied in a similar way to lots of different organizing tasks.Anyway, even though these labels are working great for me, I do have one complaint about how they are packaged and I hope I can describe it correctly.  Most printer labels I've used in the past have had a solid backing sheet with another solid sticker layer over it - which includes a large sticker that will just get thrown away since it covers all the area where the actual labels aren't.  In the case of these labels, that extra sticker sheet has already been removed so all you have on each sheet is a solid backing layer and then the individual labels.  The problem with this approach (which I hadn't thought of before) is that it becomes easy to knock the labels off the backing sheet accidentally since the edges are exposed - this is just something to be aware of if you aren't using all the labels on a page at the same time.Overall, I'm completely satisfied with this product and I highly recommend them."
721,"It seems like I buy more and more items online these days - which has also resulted in more online returns.  My previous process was to print a return label on normal paper, cut out the label, and then use about 6 feet of packaging tape to attach it to the return box. :)Fortunately, these labels save a lot of that hassle.  What I do now is save the shipping label as a .jpg and then insert it into MS Word using the Avery 5126 label template.  At that point I can print out a return label that I apply over the original shipping label.  You can't see through these and you don't need to waste tons of packaging tape to get the job done!Since each package contains 50 labels, I suspect it will last me quite a while before I need to buy another one:)."
721,"This pop-up tape dispenser is a life saver when it comes to bulk present wrapping.  It slides onto my hand easily and is far easier to use than a standard roll of tape.  It's the kind of thing that leaves me wondering why someone didn't think of it before?Having said that; I'm a little torn on this product since it is such a great idea, but the long-term utility will depend on the availability of replacement strips.  The strips are more expensive than regular tape rolls, but not by so much that they are unaffordable.  I guess it just depends on whether the idea takes off with customers - if so, then the price will probably come down and the refills will always be available.For now, I know this has changed the way that I'll be wrapping presents:)."
721,These labels are easy to run through my laser printer using the standard Avery 5160 template.  They look great after printing and they stay in place on the envelope.It's hard to think of much wrong with a product like this that does exactly what it says it will do.
3169,These boxes worked great for moving my office supplies from one floor to another. They are sturdy and I like how easily they go together and also break down for future use. You could easily use these boxes over and over again without ruining them by the buckling. Love them!
3169,"I really enjoy the firmness and thickness of this 3M Wrist Rest. I have had two mouse pads that contain gel wrist rests in them and while I do like them, they can at times, feel a little too squishy. This 3M Keyboard Wrist Rest has an extra layer of a kind of imitation leather over the gel to give it a firmer, yet still comfortable feel.The wrist rest is a few inches wide, which is nice since rests that are too narrow actually feel as if they are putting more pressure into your wrists instead of supporting them. The black leather-like material really looks sharp and would be suitable for any office environment and any professional setting.The Antimicrobial design 3M has designed this to have, is said to help inhibit growth of bacteria. This is to help prevent unpleasant smells and staining of the wrist rest. It also is to help prevent the rest from degrading.The underside of the rest is smooth, but is made of a rubber that prevents the rest from sliding around on the desk or keyboard tray.I also use this with my large 19 inch laptop (not just my desktop computer). Larger laptops are wide enough that you can actually place this wrist rest on top of the lower part of the laptop (over the built-in mouse pad) and use it to rest your wrists on for extended typing. Makes typing on a large laptop much more comfortable!"
3169,"This Swingline laminator seals well and I haven't run into any problems with the pages I've laminated coming apart.  It's small size makes it handy for using in a home office, a classroom or anywhere else with limited desk space. Also it's compact design would make it a good choice to use if you have to travel with a laminator. Such as working a booth at show or working a sign up table at event where you may have to make and laminate name tags for people coming in. It's easy to bring along and wouldn't take up much room in your luggage.While it may be small, it's still large enough to laminate full size papers, photos, documents, cards, etc. It heats up very fast, being ready to use in just minutes. It has a ready/not-read light to show it's status and even beeps to let you know when it's ready to use. If your looking for a laminator that small in size but works like a large one, this Swingline is a great choice."
3169,"This will be a dream to have around the house during the holidays! We all have those rolls of clear tape somewhere that we use to tape up packages to mail out. This takes those rolls and give you more control. The tape stays ready for the next box, instead of needing to spend a few minutes looking for the tape ends to start peeling. Nice handle that gives you control over the tape with one hand while you hold your box in the other. Bright color gives it a more consumer feel versus it's professional counterparts made of large heavy metal parts. Very much a great tool to have in any home!"
3169,"Everything a glue stick can do, this can too. The difference, the Dot Roller does it without clumps of glue making your paper bumpy, without drying out like glue and the adhesive from the DOT Roller still holds even after it's dry (always a toss up if glue from a stick will or not). This is definitely better than white glue in a bottle since that can make paper damp and cause puckering. This is a great little item to have on hand when getting ready to do any school projects."
3169,"These markers write in deep bold colors and erase from dry erase boards easily. They're described as fine tip, but they tend to write a little wider than what one might normally think of as a fine tip. But they still work really well and they clean off without leaving any writing behind. I use them on my small dry erase board in my office and they've performed great."
3169,"Great simple labels. I use the for my paperwork at my place of employment. They look a bit more professional then the typical yellow or orange square sticky note I had been using and look good for writing notes that I affix to papers for other co-workers. You can read them better then the colored stick notes, but stand out more than  just using a white sticky note which can get overlooked. They work well."
3169,"These labels work nice and stick well. They are a little small for using on a large box though. I would say these work for small to medium sized boxes, but anything larger and the label kind of gets lost on the box. These also work well for large envelopes."
3169,"The 2 desk-grip dispensers work quite interestingly. They are not sticky on the bottom like I thought they would be. They hold to smooth surfaces, working almost like a suction cup, but not exactly. The material that holds the dispensers to the surface is almost like a soft rubber. It seems to work with a soft-suction like design. Safer for surfaces, like finished wooden desks, than a typical suction cup would be. It works very well for staying put while pulling out the pre-cut pieces of tape.The 2 hand-band dispensers work great for when you need tape and your not at a desk to use the desk-grip dispensers. These are a lifesaver when sitting on the living-room floor wrapping Christmas gifts. Instead of taking a bunch of pieces of tape, cutting them off and then sticking them to what ever you have nearby (a table, your arm, the wall, etc.) and risking damaging the surface, instead it's like have an ample supply of pre-cut pieces of tape, sticking right on the back of your hand.Loading the tape into the dispensers is easy enough my 9 year old daughter can do it. There are quite a bit of tape refills in this pack, so you will have more than enough tape to get you through the entire holiday season."
3169,"What makes these different then every other label out there is the glue they use. These are removable, not just like typical sticker glue.Kind of like Command brand hooks, they are meant to go on, stay for while you need it there, then come off without leaving anything behind or taking anything away with it. This I believe is why they are a little more pricey then the every day label, because they are not the every day label.You can put these on paper or folders and they will pull off when you want to remove them, but won't tear the paper. These are good for when you need to label things for short term and want to remove the labels when you are through. These are unique in that way. It's a solution to the sticky notes that always fall off.*Edited to ad this*Also this pack has 4 different colors of labels in it (not just the blue shown in the picture). It has a neon pink, highlighter yellow, neon green, and the aqua blue (shown in the picture). Post-it offers templates for printing your own text onto these lables at their website. You just type in the leabels you have and it brings up a template for them. The you type in what ever info you want, put a sheet of the labels into your printer and hit print. Was way easier then trying to find the right one on a Works, Word or WordPerfect."
3169,"I have had the envelops in the past that you peal the waxy paper off the glued area and then you seal the envelope. While they are grate for most climates, the glue does NOT hold up to a Minnesota winter. My letters were always popping open after a day in a mailbox with subzero temperatures. I was always forced to add an additional strip of scotch-tape to the outside to make sure it stayed closed.When I got these envelops, the first thing I did was head to our deep-freezer to test them out (It's summer right now). After sealing 3 envelopes, I placed them inside. After the first day I pulled one out and it was still closed, the second one came out on day two sealed, and lastly the third one on day three. All remained sealed with no signs of opening. I believe this is due to the super strong glue used on the envelopes.I had no problems with any kind of sticking of the envelopes glue-flap that would make it difficult to seal them. They worked perfectly and I have finally found something I can mail out my bills in that won't lose my checks along the way!"
3169,I have tried using post-it's in the past while working on things for labeling. This if course ends up not working because the post-it's stick out where there is no adhesive on them and get knocked off or fall off. I then end up just using a piece of tape to attach the post-it.These is the solution for that problem. Giving you a post-it with the ability to have a fully adhesive back to it. I can;t believe they didn't think of this a  long time ago!
1860,"Most of us have started using post-its or other paper flags to note the spots in a book, file, or record which we need to get back to quickly.  Unfortunately, they're not made for this, and as a result are not very durable.  After a few reads, the book or file ends up looking very shabby, and the paper tags fold such that notes written on them can't reliably be found on the fly.These NoteTabs, while removeable, do not tear, and can be clearly marked so that they can substitute for an actual file divider.I especially like these tabs for noting my favorites in cookbooks, and unlike some similar items, all are useful as tabs, making the price reasonable."
1860,"Because it seems economically and environmentally foolish to dispose of a file folder when its current contents are no longer needed, I have tried many techniques: marking the tab in pencil so it may be erased, turning the folder inside out, and even cutting off the tab portion which was written on.These removable labels are a godsend, allowing for the neat marking of a file folder, and for the folder's reuse by the replacement of the label.  A special treat is the non-adhesive tab at the end so peeling the labels off the pad is not required."
1860,"These labels do what they have to: they adhere well once removed from the page, which means they also adhere well to the sheet until removed and don't get stuck in the printer, yet have a feature which makes them easy to peel off, which can help preserve your fingernails and sanity when you're addressing many, many labels in a short period.What distinguishes these 3M labels from the others out there is the detailed instruction sheet on how to use them, with precise directions on how to find the needed template, from the 3M website or in Word.  There is also a web link to a FAQ page.  The labels are also compatible with the Avery template, if you're switching brands after using that other brand first."
1860,"For most times of the year, a roll of tape,in a dispenser from which one can pull the ideal length, is ideal.  However, during gift-giving season the arrangement of short pieces of cut tape on a table edge or other surface, to allow for efficient gift wrapping, can be a chore.  So, for the holiday season, I would recommend the purchase of a pop-up giftwrap dispenser (along with the Scotch paper cutter) to allow for quick,  surreptitious gift wrapping during the moments when the intended recipients are elsewhere."
1860,"It's unfortunate that the makers of items, such as Post-it notes, have to associate a great product with the wrong purpose, probably because ""everyone has a laptop"".I use Post-its constantly, and generally have a pad of them in my suit jacket at all times.  I have also attached a Post-it dispenser to the side of my desktop computer monitor.  But attaching something thicker than a bumper sticker to the outside of a laptop is only going to cause you pain--laptops are designed to be slid into sleeves and bags, and anything, such as this, which protrudes is not going to last long.My ""pop-up laptop notes dispenser"" is attached to the inside front cover of the paper desk diary which I carry everywhere.  Now I can use those suit pockets for other things.This product is designed for sticking on something else, and not to work independently--it has flaps on the back with double-stick tape.  It is not a product for, say, protecting the supply of Post-its you carry in your pocket unless you first  attach it to something else (which could be just a thin piece of cardboard!)"
1860,"Because I carry tape flags to highlight pages in documents, and also always have ""traditional"" Post-It pads with me, I am delighted to lighten my pockets by carrying this roll of Post-It material, which easily serves both functions."
1860,"Moving will never be easy.  But having easy-to-assemble boxes which close securely, without tape, is a bit of a time saver.  I am also impressed at the sturdiness of these boxes, and the design which allows the contents to be secured for the move (the opposite of storage boxes which are designed for easy access).  These are NOT the boxes to get if you are putting possessions in storage and wish to get into the boxes frequently.Like most Amazon customers, I have lots of books, and appreciate boxes which are small enough to be filled without getting too heavy.  The smaller size also allows your library to be more organized upon arrival."
1860,"This is a good, sturdy wrist rest, which holds my hands in the proper position on the keyboard, and should last a long time.  It is also heavy for its size, and should stay where one puts it on the desk.On a shared desk every bit of antimicrobial protection is an asset, although what we really need is an antimicrobial keyboard!"
1860,"Especially in these economic times, we're all tempted to cut corners, but in choosing clear tape, one is best off avoiding knock-offs and generics. A new roll of Scotch tape (yes, it is a trademark) has a tab so it's easy to find the end of the roll, and the product is easy to pull off the roll, at full width, until you're down to the core.  With generics the user wastes a lot of time scraping along the roll, trying to find the end, and often pulling useless shreds instead of useable pieces of tape.No matter how thrifty you need to be, don't waste your scarce resources on any tape but Scotch.  This particular package is not the most cost-effective, but if you go cheaper, buy one dispenser and then the roll-only multiples, not another brand."
1860,"These tabs, which are sturdy enough to be used to index books or records--sturdier than their paper counterparts--are made of a plastic which can be written on.What you get in a package are twelve long pieces of this plastic, which can be torn at the perforation to make four pieces each, but it is unclear what use the last three pieces, without tabs, would have.I would recommend this particular set of tabs only for a small job, say, indexing a textbook for an open-book exam.  I will also look forward to reading other reviews to learn possible uses for the other 36 tabless sheets in the package."
1860,So many certificates and other documents I wanted to safeguard and display.  This laminator works quickly and efficiently. The best part is that it won't take up a lot of space between uses.
1860,"While there is of course another brand which has become synonymous with sticky notes, the Avery notes are at least as good--I find these Avery notes adhere better than that other brand (which, curiously, has had to offer an extra-sticky version)--and are a better value.  Avery now offers all the colors and styles you could want in a sticky note.My latest innovative use of sticky notes: marking the desired fill line on my coffee machine's reservoir, because the actual markings are hard to see."
1860,"Since Scotch is the go-to maker of transparent tape, including the double-stick tape usually used to mount photos, drawings, and the like for collages and other art projects, it is no surprise that this innovative ""Adhesive Dot Roller"", also made by Scotch, is effective for such jobs.A benefit of this dispenser over double-stick tape (which is, of course, far superior to the loops of regular tape one used before double-stick tape was widely available) is that there are no concerns about the tape sticking to the crafter's hands or not lying flat.It is true that this product is somewhat expensive as compared to double-stick tape, so it is not the product for day-to-day toddler artwork for which perfection is not an issue, but for professional-looking projects which you want to be perfect, the Adhesive Dot Roller is far superior to tape."
1860,"The problem with using double-stick tape for mounting photos and other flat items is that you have to get it right the first time.  These mounts allow you to lift and re-place while preparing a project, and, according to the directions, can even be ""refreshed"" by washing to allow reuse after they become less adhesive due to dust, etc.Because they are advertised as ""photo safe"", they could even be used to place captions on photos.Given their durability, these mounts are an excellent value."
1860,"Most highlighters die prematurely because the caps are lost or left off too long, leading the ink to dry out.  With retractable, self-sealing technology, these Sharpie highlighters are sure to last longer.  Instead of the usual couple of boring colors, this pack provides eight color choices, to distinguish different categories of text or just for fun.I wouldn't have expected less from Sharpie, and am delighted with these highlighters."
1860,"Even if these 3M whiteboard erasers cleaned equally well as felt erasers, the fact that they can be rinsed thoroughly makes them superior.While I haven't done a side-by-side test, it does seem that less effort is required to remove marker from whiteboard with these erasers than with the traditional felt erasers.  I recommend them."
1860,"The flaw in most self-sealing envelopes is that there is a backing to pull off.  This envelope is designed with a flap which unfolds, exposing an adhesive service which may then be sealed.  Unfortunately, because the fold remains, it is more likely to re-seal to itself than to stay flat so that the envelope may be closed neatly.As promised, the blue lining does create privacy, but like other reviewers, I don't see the red ""reveal"" when the envelope is reopened.I'll go back to traditional envelopes which require moistening."
1860,"At first I was shocked at the cost of this binder, considering that one could buy two or three others for the same price.  But this one is so much easier to use, with the rings on the bottom, and is likely to stay aligned so much longer, with the peg-and-hole construction.  It is sturdy and I would recommend it for heavy-duty use, whether in an office, holding reference material (what I'm using it for), or by a student who is hard on his or her school supplies."
1860,"I am a major consumer of Post-It notes.  In addition to always having a pad of them in my suit jacket pocket, there is usually one on my desk.  Unfortunately, there are a lot of things on my desk so the Post-Its aren't generally in plain view, nor is the pen I'd be using to write my note.This dispenser is an ideal solution.  While some might put it on the wall, my ""flat"" screen is deep enough that it's handily attached to the side of my computer monitor, with Post-Its at the ready and a pen in the holder.This could be made even better by putting another pen holder on the other side, which wouldn't limit one to attaching it to the monitor's right side."
1860,"This item is advertised as the ""ultimate"" in tape delivery, and the blurb suggests that you don't have to go looking for tape because it ""stays with you"", but unless the user is going to wear this handband 24/7, this doesn't make a lot of sense.If, when you gift wrap, you always use two-inch lengths of tape (and I don't), you still must consider if having these two-inch lengths pre-cut for your convenience is really worth a price which is double that of an ordinary roll of Scotch tape which has a cutter on its dispenser.  In addition, if this is your Scotch tape of choice, you will need to have a backup package or three, because 75 small pieces of tape are not going to go far in wrapping a pile of gifts.We have all purchsed off-brand tape, and as a result wasted time trying to find the end which is taped to the roll.  But the regular roll of Scotch tape, packaged in a dispenser, is all you need for convenient gift wrapping, and is half the price."
1860,"Because I like to place folders of materials I want to be able to find easily within case folders, I was attracted to these because of their bright colors.  They are sturdy and can be re-used, and the tab area is generous, allowing the user to write notes, and not just one line, in that space.  I write on these folders in pencil, so I may erase and reuse, but one could also place file folder labels over the previous designation.These folders do cost more than some which are thinner, but I find that many of those less sturdy folders start shredding and need to be replaced mid-task.  I therefore recommend these highly."
1860,"Sticky notes have become so essential to me that I am rarely without them, carrying the smaller pads with me whereever I go.  They allow me to make a temporary reminder note on a document or file without defacing the permanent item.These are three-inches square, which is a perfect size for a sentence or two, and are four bright colors unlikely to blend into the item which is being marked.This format, a pad of 400 sheets, is perfect to keep on a desk or to mount nearby with double-stick mounts.Of course, Avery isn't the only company which makes this kind of sticky note, but they do charge less for what is an identical item, so I would recommend these over the other leading brand."
689,"Hello, my name is Tamara and I'm a book abuser.  However, thanks to Avery's NoteTabs, I haven't committed much abuse for nearly a month.  I'm also swearing a lot less.I'm a writer, and while researching I highlight passages, write in the margins, dog-ear pages, and commit a number of other atrocities.  Post-It Notes get trashed or lost. Bookmarks don't stand a chance, but these plastic NoteTabs are able to withstand my torture and thrive.The NoteTabs are perforated. The top one has a tab that marks a page and you can use it whole for long notes that stay put but lift off easily, or you can take them apart.  While tabs on the lower sections might be nice, they still work just fine and also allow me to highlight/note-take on several parts of the same page.What I don't use for marking up research books, I use to edit manuscript pages.  Editing on a computer is no fun -- to do it right, I like to print out a copy and edit by hand. Being able to see through the notes is invaluable.  It's especially useful with heavy editing.I've also been using the tabbed sections to mark everything from the page of whatever novel I'm reading, to masses of papers that need filing.  They'd be terrific in cookbooks.I'll be buying lots more of these! As Tony the Tiger says, they're great!"
689,"I love this Swingline laminator. It warms up very quickly and all you do is insert your document - any size up to 12&#34; wide - in a  plastic pouch (3-5 ml thicknesses) and feed it through, front to back.  It's very simple.The laminator can cover 13 inches per minute.  I had no trouble with bubbles or scrunching of the pouches. Because this compact machine has no sleeve, though, it's important to wipe it clean after each use. If you don't, you could possibly have jamming troubles. (There is a jam alert and release in case of the worst.)At $75, this is a great buy. Small, lightweight, easy to move and maintain, it's everything I need in a laminator. It's great for a small office."
689,"These Post-It sized notes with tabs are simply the best I've ever used. Each note has a traditionally-sized tab so that bookmarks and notes are one in the same, which saves me the headaches my old method of marking a book, manuscript or screenplay my old routines gave me.  No more torn off bits of paper bookmarks to fall out, no more dog-earring pages, far less swearing as I try to find the pages I need to refer to or edit. No more writing directly on things or on the old paper Post-Its that don't stick well and wrinkle.Writing on these reusable NoteTabs is a breeze with all the pens I've tried. While ballpoint is always my first choice, gel and other types of ink work fine as well. The notes not only stick, they also come off easily.I love 'em!"
689,"There's no denying it: I was born an office supply junkie, and Avery's Round Edge NoteTabs feed my addiction beautifully.The tabs are reusable and can be written on, too.  I especially like them for marking sections in books. The rounded shape make them a more natural fit than squared ones for long-term markings. If you have a thick book loaded with chapters that you wish you could turn to easily without checking the table of contents every time, these are just the thing.I've done this with several fat research tomes already and they speed up my work more than I ever expected.  With these, I can also use Avery's selection of squared tabs to mark particular pages without getting confused.  I just love these little guys!"
689,"These Avery labels are about as close to perfect as they can be. As a small business owner who's rabidly ADD, I struggle to keep track of files.  I learned to use colored folders and it helps a lot, but there are always new stacks of paper that need to go in new folders.  If I stop everything to make P-Touch or laser printer labels, that's it for organizing.  More interesting things inevitably grab my attention.  But these colored removable labels are the answer to my problems. They're fast and painless.I can grab a blank file folder, insert the papers and slap on a labels, jot the info on it, and that's that.  Green for bills/receipts, white for records, blue for tax stuff. Later, when I have a dozen or two folders stacked up, I get out the P-Touch and make ""real"" labels.  The Avery labels come off cleanly. I often reuse them.The labels have a nifty little tab on one edge that you can tear off or leave for sticking-out purposes should you want to use one in place of a Post-It note. (In my other small business -- writing books -- these are priceless as bookmarks. There's plenty of room to write notes to myself on them so I know why I bookmarked a page of research material.)Another use is to label CDs that I'm using for backup -- I do this when I can't find my Sharpie marker, which is maybe half the time.  I often cut them into multiple pieces as well. They stick so much better than Post-Its and don't curl either, so they're great for leaving notes on my computer screen, desk hutch, bathroom mirror, fridge, and just about anywhere else.The packaging is simple and spare.  I love this item!"
689,"Simply put, these shipping-size labels are exactly what they claim to be: they're suitable for printers and they stick where you put them.Labeled for laser, they work fine in my ink jet printer, too.But I usually just hand-address labels and that's where I thought these might fall down.  I tried every kind of ink - ball point, gel, markers, you name it.  Immediately after writing each time, I swiped the edge of my hand across the label to check for smearing.They passed the test.  Not one ink smeared.  So while these are nothing more than shipping/address labels, they are definitely five-star labels.  Highly recommended."
689,"These Post-it labels are made to use in laser or ink jet printers. The brilliant colors -- green, pink, yellow, blue -- are a godsend for me.  I'm extremely ADD and in charge of a small business's bookkeeping and organizing, and if you've experienced (or have) ADD yourself, you know how important color is in jogging the memory.  I'm using these on office folders to keep them in the right spots as I attempt to put 2009 in order as well as 2010.These stick well but are completely removable.  As Tony the Tiger says, ""They're great!"""
689,"I've probably been living in a turnip patch, but I've never seen a binder with the paper rings mounted on the inside back rather than the spine - and that explains why I've never been a ring-binder fan. The regular kind never hold enough.I've been using this puppy to hold my research for an upcoming book. You can slide a cover sheet into it and slip all sorts of notes into the inner plastic envelopes. But that's nothing: I probably have 400 pages of notes (regular 20 lb. paper stabbed mercilessly with a three-hole punch) in the binder now and there's room for more. Good thing, too. I'll be stuffing it to the gills before I'm through with this project.I've never kept my notes in a binder before and I never could keep track of them, either. I was born disorganized; I waste half my life looking for things that were right here just a moment ago.  In that stack. Or that one. Or in one of those drawers. Or under the cat. No matter where it is, it doesn't show up again before I print out a fresh copy.That's why I'm loving this binder.  I figure it's saved me at least 100 sheets of paper and a quarter of a container of ink already. These days that means a lot. Using the binder has not only saved me  money and time; it's allowed me to save up an incredible amount of foul language that I'll now have ready for worthier occasions.Waste not, want not. Know what I mean?"
689,"If you like your labels bright and bold (I do) these are a great pick.  They're super-sticky but also easy to remove. I've used other bright sticky labels, but none are such a great size or as reliable when it comes to staying where you put them.I use them in my office to separate stacks of paper, to call attention to items I'd probably forget about otherwise, and this morning, to call the postman's attention to a letter he's delivered to our business twice now. I bet this time he'll notice the ""Not at this address!"" message!These are great for jotting down phone numbers or info while on the phone.  I haven't lost one since I began using these sticky little guys. (Before, if I didn't lose one, it was a miracle.)These come in note-pad form and that makes them even greater for everything you need to remember in any situation.  I write down addresses on them as well as computer passwords and recipes and leave them on the pad until I can slip them into whatever permanent form I need.  Highly useful!"
689,"I was attracted to Scotch's Handband Dispenser from the first time I saw an ad, but couldn't justify the price when I had a roll of tape on hand.  But as Christmas neared, I took the plunge.Am I glad I did.  This little item fits your wrist and makes it easy to grab a piece of tape.  In my case, this means my packages are somewhat presentable, with lots less torn corners, wrinkles, and swearing.  (I absolutely loathe wrapping gifts.)With lots of leftover strips, I began using them at my office, especially while getting small items ready to mail. They're just right for reinforcing the edges of envelopes, as well as taping to-do reminders where I'll see them.  Basically, they're worth the money for virtually all awkward taping situations. They go farther than I expected. If they were just a little cheaper, I'd give them five stars."
689,"I absolutely love Post-it's new adhesive tape.  It's 400 inches of 1-inch wide neon green, fully sticky-backed heavy stock paper. It dispenses like tape and you can pull off as much or or little as you need without any effort.  I've been using it for everything from labeling containers of leftovers so I don't have to dig through the fridge to highlighting spines of books that I pull from the the shelf all the time -- it's wonderful not to have to stop and study all the faded spines; I just go for the green.I've even labeled vegetables from the garden so I know which squash needs to be used or processed first -- and it sticks!  Yesterday, I wrote down a complicated address and stuck it to my steering wheel and didn't have to keep glancing away from the road to remember the number.While I would recommend using regular Post-It Notes for sticking to book pages or other kinds of delicate paper, I'm using this for everything else.  I didn't have a mailer for some material I was taking to the post office, so I wrote it down, stuck it to the material and wrote it on the priority envelope when I got to the PO. No digging around in my purse for the scrap of paper.The possibilities are endless, and so's my love for this little item. It's bright, quick, and sticks.  I never want to be without a roll again!"
249,This is a sturdy box for our heavier items like books and kitchenware.  I agree with the other reviewer that it was a bit difficult to figure out how to fold the box.  We plan to use it as a temporary storage box once we move in.
249,"High quality binder that allows you to print and insert a cover page into the front cover of the binder.  The one-hand opening for the rings is also a nice feature.  Once closed, you cannot open the rings unless you open it with the bottom lever.  This is a very nice feature as I have often had my binder rings open accidentally.  The binder rings are secured to the back of the binder so the front of the binder wraps around the rings for higher capacity.  Lastly, there are two staggered pockets in the front and back, this allows for easier organization of your papers.  I like this higher quality binder and recommend that you get it!"
249,The colors are pretty but the functionality is not all that different from 3M's sticky notes.  This is a great size for multi-purpose uses.
249,"These 2 inch durable post-its are great for notes as well as marking pages for future reference.  I especially like their different colors so that I can use them for different purposes - yellow for signatures, green for notes & red for most important discussions."
249,I often use folders for a few weeks and then throw them away once the project is completed.  This product enables me re-use folders.  It saves me money and enables me to produce less waste.  Win-win!
249,Well-made folders.  I especially love the nice colors and the ability to handwrite on the tabs!  They are far better than the standard dark green issues of old.
249,These labels use the Avery templates and are very easy to peel off.  What is there not to like?
249,I agree with the other reviewers about Post-its falling off or curling due to the small adhesive area.  These are far better with 100% adhesive at the back.  I can now stick these on virtually anywhere without worrying about them falling off or curling.  Love it!The only downside for these is that you can't really print on these with your printer due to the odd size.  It's not a deal breaker for me since I usually use pen or market anyway.
249,"It is super sticky and reusable, far better than the typical sticky notes.  I use these to label my aromatherapy bottles and they stay on!"
249,I am not sure why there is a need for this product.  Can you just stick a book of regular stickie to the side of your computer?  Why pay more???
249,I re-use my bottles for aromatherapy.  These labels are great as they allow for mess-free removal when I change the contents of the bottle.  I highly recommend these labels.
249,I have been using Avery labels in the past and these 3M labels are as good as those Avery ones at a cheaper price.  I actually like these a bit better since they are easier to peel off with the space between each column of labels.  There is no noticeable difference between the paper quality of the two brands.  I can also use my old Avery templates with these labels.
1708,If I were going to move I would definitely buy these boxes to pack with. They are very simple to assemble with a few simple and numbered in order folds. No tape needed and handles to boot! They are very sturdy and easy to stack since you can get all the same size. The large and medium would be my choices for moving but the smaller size makes a great storage box for income tax stuff. They have a place to write the room and contents of the box. If using for income tax records and business papers they make storage much neater then those accordion type folders that fall apart and self destruct after a year of filing. I would recommend these for anyone needing a neat way to store annoying paperwork or someone needing moving boxes for more delicate items that can't be piled heavy. Great item!
1708,"The good:*They are pretty easy to assemble, the diagrams are right on the box but some text would have been helpful in figuring out there are panels and handles included aside from the boxes themselves. I was left wondering why there was a big gaping hole in the side, then my husband found the panels and handles in the trash. Ah, now it all makes sense!*The large clear side panel is nice, you can see inside of each box even when stacked several high.*They are quite sturdy and made of heavy cardboard. The lid fits nice and tight.*They are attractive and neat, much nicer to look at then an ugly brown box.*Nice size for a small at 12x15 (taken inside) and 6.5 with the lid on.Things that could be better:*When these arrived I didn't assemble them right away and tossed out the big shipping box with the handles and clear acetate windows still in the bottom of the shipping box. The assembly instructions are in tiny diagrams 1-11 but do not clearly show window panels. There should be a list of what should come with the boxes preceding the assembly instructions. They are not hard to assemble but it would be helpful to know what pieces should be there before trying to decipher tiny diagrams with no text at all. Luckily we found the panels and handles while recycling the shipping box!*The clear panel should have had adhesive to make it fit a bit tighter , not a big issue though and that would have made these even pricier which is another con. Tape worked fine too.*The handles are a bit hard to snap together. They do fit nice and tight but you really have to push hard to close the gap. They are very secure though once together.All in all, pretty darn nice storage boxes that I will make good use of."
1708,"These are excellent page markers! They are 7/16''x1 3/4'', you can write on them (use a sharpie) and move them if needed, they will not tear the page. They come on a very nice compact and neat plastic card that can self clip to a folder or book. I like that they are all on a one card rather then all separate. You get a lot too, there are 100 of them in 5 different colors! I highly recommend them and will buy them again."
1708,"I use both Post it and Avery sticky notes and I can't tell any difference between the two. I even put one of each on the fridge and peeled it off and on 30+ times and both had equal stick. I would buy either brand based on price alone, both are good."
1708,This is the neatest product! You get four different color bordered tabs and each color comes in a stack of 6 much like sticky notes. They are made of a durable yet paper thin acetate so they don't add any thickness when a lot of paper is stacked or inside a book to mark pages. The writing surface is a mat finish which is great for markers but if you use pencil it was surprising to me you could erase it and reuse them. These are like regular tabs having sticky on the bottom 2/3 of the back but the side you write on is on the opposite side. So the entire 2''x1.5'' is exposed on the page or folder in other words they don't go to the back of a folder or page they go on top so you will see the whole 2x1.5 tab. Actually the entire area is the same texture so you can make notes on the whole thing not just the 1/3 at the top in white. This is very cool for using in cookbooks you can make notes on the tab rather then writing on the book! They are also easily removable without damaging the page. Great for flagging a book. I use them in my field study notebooks indicating dates and things of interest so I can easily flip to that page when I need to refer back. I will definitely be buying more of these they are just so great for so many things!
1708,What a cool product this is!I wasn't quite sure what to expect but this little dispenser just floats across the surface with ease leaving behind rows of nearly invisible tiny adhesive dots. Make your own sticky notes on any paper in a snap. Great to put photos in an album or making your own greeting cards or any paper project where you want sticky but no tape. It is also great fun to use if you can believe that. GREAT product! I would definitely buy this product and recommend it for sure!
1708,"I really like these little sticker pads especially these with the outlined border for using on file folders. They come in three colors all on one solid backing so they all stay together. They have sticky on the entire back and stay in place very securely but they are removable with no tearing or mess left behind. The rounded tab has no sticky so you can easily pull off one at a time and the tab can be left on for labels you will be removing frequently or removed for a more permanent but still removable application. Very handy product. I like the borderless ones even better especially for use in making notes in a cookbook they have a light solid color with no border leaving more room for writing. These are more for labeling things like file folders or boxes and binders. Great product, they seem even more sticky then Post-it brand. Not sure how they stay in place over long term I'll get back to you on that but they do seem very secure."
1708,These are perfect for labeling file folders with a non-removable label. They really stick! They cover most of the tab area on a file folder being 3-7/16'' long and 2/3'' tall. You can print on these using a template and they are for both inkjet as well as laser printers. They are also great to hand write on and use for other applications besides just on file folders. The adhesive really sticks like all of the quality 3M adhesive products. Only one complaint if I had to find one and that would be that like all labels on the market the white ones are all on the see through side. If you are placing a label over writing or another printed label the one behind will show through a bit. Not a huge problem really but they all seem to have this in common. Overall this is an excellent product and it gets 5 stars in my book!
1708,"I didn't care for this product right from the time I started to try and figure out how to load it, the cover was quite difficult to slide open and the unit slides around on smooth surfaces like formica. It is not a normal suction that stays put this one is more a friction type and while it does stay on the table when you pull straight up on the tape, it still slides around freely, weird. You have to really snatch the tape strip with some force otherwise you get two stuck together. I also hated that each tape strip came out with the end bent making it difficult to place the strip. I see no good reason to purchase this product and would not recommend it, I'll stick to a normal dispenser with scotch brand tape of course."
1708,"These are great labels and much better then the label pads this company makes where you can't tear off at the perforation without leaving an ugly jagged edge. These are on a sheet of wax paper so you just peel and stick. I just write on them with a pen but I don't see why my inkjet wouldn't print on them even though the package only says ""Laser"". I like that you can remove them once you've put them in place and I like that you have 4 colors. They have nice clean rounded corners so they look professional and neat. Great product with really strong adhesive yet removable!"
1708,"I would give this 5 stars for great adhesive and removability but the little tear off piece is terrible. The perforation is useless leaving a jagged ugly edge. I understand why they tried to market it this way since people are use to the pad form of Post-it products but these would have been much more user friendly had they left them as individual wax paper backed labels and sold them in the same zip lock storage pouch they already came in.I much prefer their product called Color-Coding Labels sold in an 8.5x11 sheet size format with waxed paper backing for easy removable labels. There are 4 colors rather then just two and they have clean rounded edges for a much nicer finished look. They can be printed on with your printer (the package I received was for laser, not sure they make them for inkjet?) but they are nice to hand write on as well and they are smaller labels 1''x2-5/8'' so they are great on file folders as well as other applications. They need to work on the above product some more I would not recommend them as they are now."
2718,"This is one of those things that you didn't realize you needed until you try it (of course, after trying it you still might decide you don't need it)That is to say, it could be considered a ""acquired taste"" and therefore I would't recommend it to everyone.I'd suggest that they are best for avid readers or people doing research.They are basically sticky notes which are transparent and have adhesive over the entire back side.  You can write on them with pencil, pen, etc.I tend to highlight and jot notes in many books - cookbooks, business reference, hobby, self help, etc. etc...Sometimes these books aren't mine (borrowed or library books)  If that's the case, out come the sticky notes.When I first tried these I was afraid they would smudge with either a rollerball or gel ink pen, but was pleasantly surprised that they didn't.  If you use pencil, you can easily erase.I also use this as a marker on my wall calendar to note which day it is.  As I have a lot of notes on my calendar, I still want to see what's under my highlight.I'm used to using various sizes of sticky notes and having to place them approximately where I want to write or memo something.I'd probably give it 3-1/2 stars if that were an option - the additional deduction based on cost.  These are not cheap.Disclosure: I received these through Amazon Vine.If this review was helpful or if you have any questions, please let me know!"
2718,"These are identical to the 3M Post-It note in every way I could determine,  The main difference is that these came in four different pastel colors.  there are also other colors available - enough that my boss uses these to color code paperwork to various projects.I would note that the sticky patch is the same size and stickiness as the regular 3M Post-Its, and I've come to prefer the ""Super Sticky"" sticky  notes.  These really stay put, and I always get them for the same price as the regular Post it notes"
2718,"I'm more of a pen nut these days but back in engineering school I would burn through mechanical pencil 0.05 leads like crazy.  The leads broke all the freaking time and the pencils would jam so I'd usually have at least 2 or three on my desk, particularly in an exam.This is pretty cool.  I wasn't able to break the lead under some pretty severe tests.  Not sure if this is the ""diamond"" lead or the twist mechanism.  I will test out some Pentel Hi Polymer HB and see...Likes:- Lives up to claim of lead not breaking- Nice weightDislikes:- Barrel has very small no slip ring - so it slips a bit (and harder to spin)- No retracting tip!!!  Sorry, not wearing a pocket protector- Lead is a little dark - This is HB but not as dark as Pentel HB."
2718,"These markers are smaller than I expected, (SEE PICTURE) but then again there are some pretty compact dry erase boards for use in lockers, on refrigerators, etc.Including the sizable cap, these are just shy of 4-3/4 inches long.  The line they lay down is quite narrow, about 1/32"" wide, so you're not going to use these if your audience is more than about 3-4 feet from the board.The magnets are OK for keeping the pen in the tip up or down position - if you put them on the fridge sideways they will spin around and fall off.The colors are quite vibrant though the yellow, not surprisingly, was hard to read.For larger boards I'd suggest theBoard Dudes Double-Sided Magnetic Dry Erase Markers, 4 Packs (14002UA-24)"
2718,"&lt;Summary> Very convenient way to attach papers for scrapbooking etc,Very simple idea - like a correction tape dispenser each pass lays down a series of very small glue dots - each do is about 1/16-1/32 diameter, the stripe is effectively 5/16"" wide.This allows for very neat and precise placement of your adhesive.Note: The adhesive is a faint blue, it's not technically a repositionable adhesive - glue comes off onto both surfaces, but you have several minutes to pull it off and put it back on if you're trying to make something line up.Disclosure: I received this item through Amazon VineIf you've found this review helpful or have comments/questions, please let me know!"
2718,"Summary - a much more economical and efficient alternative to dedicated labelers.When you're labeling spice jars, you want it to be permanent and waterproof.  For many other things, not so much.I have a Brother P-Touch labeler which is great for permanent and waterproof labels (though the refills are ridiculously expensive.  Fantastic for spice jars, but often you want to be able to remove the labels.  I just tried these and was very impressed.  I relabeled my handwritten file folders next (not that many since I was using the Brother labels)The template worked perfectly on my laser printer.  The labels being all the same size look a lot nicer on the pantry shelves than the Brother labels, which end up being different lengths.  Much cheaper and faster too.  The laser printing and paper is far less permanent, but for organizing boxes and labeling shelves, the film cartridge labelers are overkill.Note, DO NOT GO TO THE MICROSOFT WEBSITE FOR THE TEMPLATE!Their site works only for Office 2000 and later - it wouldn't allow me to D/L the template until I accepted a trial of Word 2007.  I'm using Word 97 which is just fine thank you.  I looked around a bit more and found the template at the 3M site, no muss no fuss.  God, I hate Microsoft.If you've found this review helpful or have any questions please let me know!"
2718,"I've used Avery and Staples house brand for return address labels, and these are identical in size and computer template.  I printed the same labels as always and they came out fine.Two differences - all the extra label which normally surrounds the labels is gone so they come off easier.  This seems a small thing but when you're doing large mailings it makes a BIG difference.The second is that the adhesive seems stronger / better than the competition.  I noticed this when sticking one to packing tape.Here are some other uses for these:- Print your name / contact info and stick to anything that might get lost (cell phone, etc)- Use on your calendar for recurring events (Soccer games, piano lessons etc)  Looks nice!- ""Paid"" sticker for bills- Quick substitute for tape when doing craftsIf you've found this review helpful or have questions or comments, please let me know!"
2718,"Summary: the clicky retracting feature on a slim body is the best part of these pens.  The ""Smear Guard"" is comparable to other highlighters.I'm a self described pen junkie.  I've always taken very detailed notes - I find the key is to use different colors and highlighters to separate thoughts or to draw connections between items.  This means I'm often highlighting notes I've just written.  Smudging is a minor annoyance.At first I thought ""Smear Guard"" was a little gimmicky, and in fact I can't tell the difference in bleeding between this, a ""hype"" retractable from Staples, and a BIC Bright Liner.  For the record, conventional ball point pens bleed less than ink or gel roller ballsWhat I really like is that I'm not forgetting to put the cap back on.  I can't tell you how many pens I've had to toss because they dried out.There are a couple of other retractable highlighers out there but the ones I've bought are very fat and don't fit in normal pen holders (the Staples ""Hype"" for example)  These are a bit longer but do fit in standard planner loops, etc.  Keeps it where I need it.Why four stars?  I would have given it five but the dark blue and dark magenta are really markers - not really highlighters.  You can't xerox these and still read the text through them.Hope you found this helpful!"
2718,"After many years of selling things online, I finally got some stick on labels - definitely saves time.Running through a HP Laser printer (1300 series) they come out looking very professional.One potential issue is that if you want to use one of the pre-paid USPS services, these labels will be too small.They are the right size, however, if you want to label boxes and such.  Just realize that they will not come off easily - you will either tear the carddboard box or be spending some time with goof-off and a rag."
2718,"When you're labeling spice jars, you want it to be permanent and waterproof.  For many other things, not so much.I have a Brother P-Touch labeler which is great for permanent and waterproof labels (though the refills are ridiculously expensive.)However, those labels are overkill for the 20 gallon totes, particularly since we often change the contents.  Peeling off the Brother labels is a real pain and costly too.The template worked perfectly on my laser printer.  The labels being all the same size look a lot nicer on my Rubbermaid boxes in the basement than the Brother labels.  The color coding is also a big plus.  Much cheaper and faster as well.Note, DO NOT GO TO THE MICROSOFT WEBSITE FOR THE TEMPLATE!Their site works only for Office 2000 and later - it wouldn't allow me to D/L the template until I accepted a trial of Word 2007.

2718,"&lt;Summary> Super compact and convenient because of mounting to vertical surfaces with included removable Velcro strips, pen holder really seals the deal!Not a whole lot more you can say - how many words can you dedicate to a fist sized plastic gizmo and some paper and adhesive?We definitely like this though - I used to take regular post it notes and attach a magnet to the back so we could put them on the refrigerator.  I also have magnets on pens to keep them nearby.  This solves both problems!  The pen holder is good only for one pen/pencil and is kind of shallow - I suppose if they made it taller then you'd have a hard time with golf pencils.  That's the only complaint.Note that this takes the pop-up style notes, not the regular post-it notes."
2718,"Summary:  Great idea but I'd recommend the Post-It Super Sticky Color Coding labels instead - if the size works for you.I managed to score samples of several 3M Post-It Super Sticky products.  This product, thePost-it(R) Super Sticky Removable File Folder Labels, 0.6 x 3.4 Inches White, Laser/Inkjet, 750 labels per pack (2100-H), andPost-it(R) Super Sticky Removable Color Coding Labels, 1 x 2.6 Inches Assorted Neon, Laser, 450 labels per pack (2700-P)The three products are very similar.  It appears the adhesive is identical with the only difference being the paper thickness, color, and delivery (sheet vs pad).The file labels comes on a thinner white paper.  The size is quite narrow, though more than enough to label boxes or shelves.The paper on the ""Color Coding labels"" and ""Label Pads"" are similar except that these only come in two colors while the ""Color Coding Labels"" come in four.  The four color coding labels are narrower but about the same length as these label pads (1""x2.6"" rather than 1.8""x2.8"") but on a per label basis, these cost more than TWICE as much.Finally these are on a pad, while the ""Color Coding Labels"" come on a sheet (like address labels) which means that, if you want to, you can run the color coding labels through a printer and get REALLY organized!A pad is more convenient to store than a sheet of labels, but if you are doing a bunch of boxes, it's nice to be able to write out more than one label at a time.  With this product, you can't write the next label out until you've peeled this one off.Next, there's a strange thing they did to make it in pad form - to make it easier to peel off, there is a little tab at the bottom with adhesive and a dashed line to indicate where to tear it off.  If you wrote in that area, whoops, it's either leave it on (with the dashed line and no adhesive behind) or lose  what you wrote.The last disadvantage is that these have sharp corners while the ""Color Coding labels"" have rounded corners - which makes them stay on better.Overall, if you can live with the narrower ""Post-It Super Sticky Color Coding"" labels, I'd go that way.If you've found this review helpful or have any questions, please let me know!"
1043,"I have been a Georgia Pacific fan for years and it is such a pleasure to be able to buy it by less than a case.  For me, three reams are better than a 10 pack.  The brightness is quite satisfactory and the poundage is the same.  I have had no jams compared to some paper products that jam the printer's paper route.I would reconsider sending r&eacute;sum&eacute;s on this type of paper in lieu of a higher brightness and poundage paper only because I believe in that first impression is so important and I would not want a piece of paper to be a downer.  This is the type of paper I would send to my Congressman or Senator.I rate this as &#34;I'll be back in a few months for a reorder&#34; product and recommend it with ease."
1043,"Avery likes to call these gems Note Tabs Round but I have know the brand so long I still call them labels.  They are perfect for what they are.  They tell me where I want to be when I need to find something in a book or file.  The round edge makes it easy to use and the color makes it easy to see.  The first thing I noticed is the thickness of the label.  It is unlike what I grew up with in the dark ages.  It is thick enough to last and not fall apart.  However, it is not too thick so that it would interfere with usage.  Another feature I really like is the ability to remove the label and reuse it in a different place in a recipe book or whatever.If you have small children or planning to do so, you might consider using these little goodies for ruler devices.  Instead of using a marker, which can and will leave permanent marks, on the wall or molding consider using the label and mark the height and date on it for each time period you decide on.  Then should you have to move you can save them.  You can later give them to the child for a scrap book item."
1043,"To say it is just a label is an understatement.  It performs all the tasks I expect from a label; however, best of all it removes easily and in some cases I can use it again.  Not that often but it works.  I especially like the 1 X 3 size. That size works best for me by permitting larger symbols (letters, numbers etc.) that these old eyes can see without getting the cheaters.  The colors work well for me especially when I have a plan or project that calls for single colors and other colors.  It's possible that with a bit of help the labels could be printed on a printer; however, I would forgo that in lieu of not printing them.  I would opt for another label first or just not worry about printing them.  Here is a function of time:  my time is more valuable than setting up the printer to print several labels at a time.  Oh, that's right, some call that lazy.  That's me.  Rather: That's I.  I still recall many years ago when the first time I bought Avery labels and they are somewhat better today.  The early labels were permanently applied and taking them off just did not work.  Bottom line:  Would I get more:  You bet and without hesitation."
1043,Theses are handy little notes and work just perfectly.  I installed one pack on my laptop and never realized how handy a note could be until I wanted to write a URL on a piece of scrape paper.  This dispenser fit the bill perfectly and with the adhesive on the back of the note it helped me later when using the URL on the desktop.  It is out of the way and does not interfere with the laptop's operation.  It does provide an extra cushion when closing the screen.  Nice touch.Most of the time I am never satisfied with a single use product and run with the thought that there might be another use for this or that product.  This is the case with these notes.  I am often looking for a piece of paper to write a note or reminder while in the car.  Most current note paper is unsatisfactory for my needs until this product entered the scene.  Boom!  A new use.  I applied another pack to an area close to the wheel but out of the way so that when I filled the gas tank I had a piece of paper to write the data about the gas filling.  Can you imagine a day without numbers?  The notes are handy if I need to write a person's license number and now I will not have to scrounge for that ever elusive piece of paper.  While in many cases a voice recorder would work better there are times when it is not available or run down or just too worrisome to worry about.Great product and worthy of finding other uses.  I'm on itg boss!
1043,O.K. one might say it is just a pack of Post-It Notes.  I agree with one exception.  These are the perfect notes for placing information on a larger container rather than the standard sizes we grew up with.  My first use for them was to place identifier on stored documents contained in a plastic box.  The size is large enough to provide for large numbers and then permit additional identification in smaller print.  The peel off easy from the pad and stick well on the container.  Removing them from the container is simple and there is no residue.  These are simply perfect for most uses when you need to see what you wrote and subsequently want to remove it.
1043,"I really like these note tabs.  The are big enough so that I can write in large letters so that I can see them when I need to without the assistance of readers.  What makes them so good for me is that they stick almost anywhere I want them to stick and when necessary, they come off without a problem.  That, incidentally, is accomplished without hassle or tearing.  I found them to be especially useful for labeling my tax related forms and papers.  (I sure hate to start taxes again this year.  It seems as if they get harder each year even though my income goes down each year.  I sure hope the Fair Tax gets passed.  Oops.  Sorry for the political stuff.)  The tabs are just right for several uses that I have had an opportunity to try but the tax one is the best."
1043,"About two hours before this gem arrived I sought decent tape to close a box.  My old stand bye was the only thing I had and it was the usual struggle of getting the tape to start and then cutting it if I were lucky enough to keep it from binding to itself.  Then arrived my new Scotch dispenser and what a wonderful addition to the household helper inventory.  It fits my hands well and is easy to maneuver plus cutting the tape is so much better than other dispensers I have used.  Moreover, the mechanical aspects work perfectly.  I did not give it a 5 star only because I felt the size of the tape itself was too short.  That is it would require more trips to the tape store to provide continuous use.  I also felt that the actual dispenser might not last long under rigorous use.  Regardless of my possible wrong views I would still want one of these because it is truely so much better than other options that I have used and thrown away before they could break under use."
1043,"My using these tabs has helped control my outbursts considerably.  When going to a tab made out of cheap, ineffective materials and it pulls off from minor use it is frustrating.  Now with these Post-it Durable Filing Tabs life is much easier and simpler in my little 6x6 office.  They hold the paper, do not crimp or crumble, colored coded and big enough for old eyes to write on and then see what was printed without having to use a spotlight.  Before I could get them in their final resting place I found they were missing but after a while I heard the cheerful voice in the background say, ""These are fantastic!  I put them on the new folders and they work far better than anything we have used yet.""  Sharing is wonderful and so are these Tabs.  More will be on the way soon."
1043,"It is almost impossible to visit an office supply store and Not find a new Scotch product and that is wonderful.  The latest addition to a sea of goodies is the Dot Roller.  It is an abundant 49 feet of convenient material that really works.  Once readey after setting it up it holds most items quite well.  I tested several items with great success.  The fridge is the resting place for all those doctor's appointments and here we have a bunch.  Thank goodness for a large fridge.  I digress.  The normal application was magnest holding the appointment cards but not now.  About 1/2 to one inch of Dot Roller on the back of the card holds the card on the metal quite well.  Of the first batch I placed not one has fallen to the floor.  That includes the piece of 8x5 paper for Jury Duty notification which has been removed several times but is still sticking much like that little bunny keeps on running.  The only failure has been my application of a 1/2 inch long strip to the card that held the product.  It held only one day; however, I fully accept that as my failure and not the product's.  A 1/2 inch strip will not work with a piece of paper that heavy but the one inch has worked perfectly.  Pictures from 3X4 to 8X10 hang perfectly and without incidence moreover the backs do not absorb the adhesive which will help retain the picture's original quality.  I remember as a child taking a piece of the original Scotch Tape and putting in on a photo only to have my mom yell something about my not using that ""stuff"" because it left residue on the photo.  That changed and this material is not your mother's tape in any way shape or form other than it being tape that works in the same manner as other Scotch products:  Well, time after time."
1043,"I still recall the first so called silly glue or crazy glue or whatever it was called.  I could not wait to buy those two little tubes that brought moments of glee and required perfect mixing with rapid application of consistent pressure only to find that your fingers stuck to the item.Now, we have a Super Glue that is just that SUPER!  It comes in a perfectly sized container with an application spout that helps avoid sticking a finger to the project.  ( I say avoid simply because we are humans and from my personal experience with this bottle my finger got stuck, once, so far ) Regardless of any of those factors there is simply one that matters:  This Super Glue WORKS and it works well.Years ago I bought an antique snow sleigh and it needed a couple of perfectly placed drops to secure pieces that had come loose.  The Scotch stood up for the project and performed perfectly.  Three fixes that needed attention and three spots later I have a perfectly fixed sleigh.  Also, we love watching our flock of hummingbirds even though they are getting ready to return to Mexico and feeding them is an every other day event.  I use a funnel to pour the nectar into the feeder but the funnel forms a vapor lock and slows the process until I made a Super Glue fix.  I Super Glued two pieces of a paper clip on  opposing sides of the funnel spout and that little change made all the difference to opening the vapor lock.  Thanks Scotch!Super Product:  Super Glue!"
1043,3M has proven consistently that they are a reputable international company with products that work well over and over.  The 2 piece set of their Whiteboard Erasers fit that category.  They work well and are a much needed to making whiteboards even better.  They are a perfect fit for either hand and make the process so easy.  When finished I wash mine and let them air dry for the next use.  I added using them to clean my LCD screens on either monitors or TVs and they work well with a small amount of distilled water.  It's best not to have much water so the amount of streaking is eliminated.  Great product from a great company.  Who could ask for any more?
1043,"Hey, it's only an envelope.  Oh no it is NOT.  It is a secure envelope that does NOT have to be licked.  That should suffice but from my standpoint this envelope goes beyond the normal #10.  I put a payment in the regular #10 and with some ease could fairly much detect most of the information on the check.  Same check but in the Quality Park #10 and even with a strong LED power flashlight I could not read anything on the inside.  Now that's security.  Then when I do not have to lick or moisten some unknown piece of paper that (pardon the pun) seals the deal.  Now that's enough said.  Great envelope!"
1043,"There may be 5 or 6 persons around here who have not used my old favorite Pop-Up Notes.  But then again we have a lot of folks living in the back woods solely for the purpose of making moonshine and the demand for Post-it Notes is close to zero.  I think that is because only one edge has glue on it and it sticks poorly to the Mason Jar.  This new dispenser is ever so handy and so simple to use.  The whole process from opening the package to using the first note is quite simple and intuitive.  Why even a mountain person could do it.  I know.  Add the four stickums on the back and there is a perfect note dispenser.  I put mine on the fridges (kitchen and garage) so when some food runs out I have a note to make myself a note.  That may sound simple to some but wait and see as age works against you.  Added my own marking pen and away I went making notes galore.  Well, not quite galore but it is a useful device.  Shucks, what else would anyone expect from the 3M Corp?  They are a national treasure and this could become another super product in a never ending line of same."
1161,"I've tried several 3M injet label products and have been well-pleased with all of them. These are substantial labels on nice backing paper. The sheets stay flat and feed easily, and the inverse cutouts from the die-cuts have been removed so the labels are very fast and easy to remove from backing. Good adhesive, nice weight. I've used the on plastic bags and paper, and they have a good hold, even in lower temperatures. I've preferred the 3M label products to both store brand & Avery. These work with Avery templates in Word."
1161,"Although meant for tickets, these also make very perfect 2-part price tags. After printing, punch a hole in the long end of the ticket and attach to your item with string. Make sure both sides include the price and a description, then just tear the stub off at checkout for an easy way to track/double-check inventory at fairs or in a shop. They'd be especially handy with multiple sellers sharing a booth, so you could keep track of sales without holding up the checkout by writing down every single item.You can download templates to use in Word, but I like using Avery's online layout tools best. They allow you to modify a full sheet at once, or just one ticket. Same with the stubs. You can also add sequential numbers, UPC and QR codes! There are a wide range of simple designs for any occasion that you can modify/customize with your own art/wording/colors, then print everything as pdfs. Very handy!"
1161,"Like the other 3m label products I've tried, these are quite nice. The paper is similar to the familiar lightweight post-it paper. The sheets print cleanly on my fussy old inkjet printer, and the borderless labels peel off the backing easily. The labels stick securely to paper, wood, plastic bags & cloth, and you can't miss the retina-burning colors, so they're great for color-coding inventory (I'm using them to mark T-shirt sizes). I really like that you get 4 colors in one pack.I'm very happy with the 3M labels, which stick really well in the cold, even on non-porous surfaces. Many labels I've used don't stay sticky when it's cold, particularly when adhering to cold plastic. They're nice and sticky even at 55 degrees.The one thing I question is whether the bright colors would eventually transfer in long-term storage (way too soon to tell!), so I intend to use them in direct contact only with stock that moves pretty quickly."
1161,"Great labels. They don't jam, even in my fussy inkjet printer, they peel cleanly and easily from the backing, and my 6-point text prints crisply and cleanly. I'm using them on glass and they stick beautifully, despite the cold. A+ all around!"
1161,"I absolutely love these. I've used a lot of tabs, including the post-it tabs & these are definitely my favorites. They're easy to write on, nice and firm, and secure but repositionable.So far, I've used them in my cookbooks for party planning, in my GTD notebook to quickly access which lists are where, and in my weekly datebook to mark the current week for easy access.The colors are bright but still light enough not to obscure the writing, and the feel is nice and firm. I'm sure I'll be ferociously organized in no time!"
1161,"This is a great concept, and they definitely lay flatter than regular notes, but they need more sticky to be really nice and flat.These notes have the usual strip of sticky at the top, and another about 5/8""/1.5cm from the bottom--which is a bit too far from the edge. If the sticky were about a quarter inch from the bottom, the corners of the lightweight paper wouldn't curl too much, but you'd still be able to pull the not up with ease.As it is, it's flatter, but still curls up & gets mushed or folded (when you close a book, for instance).Alternately, if the paper were a bit heavier, the current positioning would probably do better.The adhesion is in the regular sticky notes range, not supersticky, so it's not good for repositioning much before it's shot. It's not labeled supersticky, so I wasn't expecting that, but I do like to use sticky notes to mark my place in patterns, and I thought the flat ones would be great for that, but the low-tack adhesive means no."
1161,"To me, the paper doesn't feel quite as sturdy as Post-its, the gold standard of removable notes, but they're pretty darn close. The adhesive is sticky and remains so after repositioning. I would say for everyday use, and for flagging books, they're probably just as good. For notes that you want to keep up semi-permanently, they're not quite as nice. The 4-color packs are great for color coding, though the pastel colors are a little bland."
1161,"I've tested and reviewed many durable tabs from both 3M and Avery. They're all essentially the same, and all excellent for their intended purpose.These are stiff, re-positionable plastic divider tabs that can be stuck and restuck mutiple times to use as page markers and dividers for any book, binder, etc. They're great for organizing notebooks and spirals, but I really love them for marking up my cookbooks and knitting pattern books.These tabs are particularly nice for quickly indexing your favorites, because of the nice wide tab and bright white writing surface.In general, I use these tabs to mark out recipes/patterns I'd like to try. Once I've actually sampled the recipe/pattern, I remove the marker for later reuse if I don't intend to make it again, or write the name of the recipe/pattern on the tab and leave it in place for quick future reference. If you have an extensive cookbook/pattern library, these are invaluable.They stick well but also remove easily. If you want to reuse them, just stick them back on top of the stack so the adhesive doesn't get crud on it. I reuse them many times without losing adhesion.If I were still a student, I'd be addicted to use these for reference and note-taking.They also make an excellent book or datebook marker."
1161,"This is a handy set of colors that's great for a fridge or magnetic whiteboard. They have magnets and erasers  built into the lids, so it's easy to keep track of the lids while you're color-coding your calendar or what-have-you, and you don't need to hunt down a cloth or dirty your fingers if you make a quick mistake. They're fine enough to write fairly small, but not superfine, about the thickness of a Sharpie.My only complaint is that the magnets are pretty weak, strong enough to hold up the pen, but not a bit more. It would be nice if they could at least hold up a sheet of paper if need be."
1161,"This is a nice, lightly viscous glue that does a pretty good job of staying put (vs the old school watery version), though it will run a bit on vertical surfaces if you don't bond it immediately. I didn't do the constuction-helmet-and-I-beam test they used in those 70s commercials, but it did a good job on various surfaces around my house (I especially like it for locking in loose screws).But the bottle here is the difference, and it really does make it easier to use. If you're like me and you always end up with super glue all over your fingers somehow, you'll appreciate the applicator, which gives you dropper control instead of the little metal tubes, which even with the gel type mix still always end up as much on me as what I'm trying to glue.But the biggest benefit to me was that with the bottle stored upright, the glue stays liquid and clog free. This was a definite plus for me, since I don't think I've ever been able to use any super glue twice--inevitably when I go back to it even a few weeks later, it's always clogged or dried up--and I don't want to pick at it or stab it with a needle, since I'll inevitable get it all over me and end up half-glued to the bottle. I used this bottle for several little jobs around the house, and when I went back for it a month or two later, it was still flowing freely. I've always stored my tubes upright and it's never seemed to prevent clogs/drying, so this was a nice surprise. The bottle seals tightly and the semi-rigid design means the excess glue can flow back into the bottle, keeping the applicator clear."
1161,"Roomy, re-positionable tabs are just the thing to mark your favorite recipes for quick reference in your cookbook collection. Would be great for student note-taking or for quick reference inside file folders."
1161,"EDITED TO ADD: I originally reviewed these with my inkjet printer (5 stars), but have since used them with my newer laser printer. The printing rubs off easily when used with a laser printer. Since they're labeled for both inkjet & laser, I have to kick them down 2 stars. They're still usable and handy for the removable aspect (they're great shelf tags in a shop), but the flaking print is unattractive.Like all the 3M inkjet products I've reviewed (this is #6), this product prints cleanly and jam-free. These are standard-size, standard-template file folder labels for 1/3-cut file folders. I love that they both stick very well and that you can remove them easily if necessary. Every time I try to cull/clean up my file cabinet, I find I have duplicate folders, and this way, you can just peel off the new label rather than ending up with several layers of labels when you want to reuse file folders. It makes it much easier to have a nice, tidy, consistent filing system. So far, they stick very well for permanent positioning.I also think these would be really handy for organizing cupboards and drawers--you could stick them to the outside and use them as a reminder of where your new stuff is until you're accustomed to the new setup, then remove them. Similarly, you could use them to label shelves in your closet/pantry/library. They would have the professional, consistent look for printed labels, but you could move them as your library grew or as you changed your mind and moved stuff to better places during a major re-organizational project. I'm planning to use them in this way when I reorganize my craft room and closet shelves."
1161,"This is one of those ideas that makes you think: why didn't anyone think of this before?I like that hanging files stay put and don't flop all over the place (I heart GTD, but the plain file system is a bust for me), but I HATE having to hunt down one of those stupid holders that inevitably go missing when you need one (and if you can find the holder, you'll never find the insert, and vice-versa).These have the practicality of a hanging folder and the convenience of a regular file folder.The tab is ultra-rigid and reinforced, so it should stand up to abuse even better than the traditional type.The one caveat is that if you use a lot of interior folders, go for the style with the gusset--these ones are deep enough to hold a folder or two without interfering with reading the tab, but if they got pretty full, the interior folders would sit high enough to obscure it. But because there are several gusseted styles of FasTab, I'm not knocking off a point for it. If you skip the interior folders or just use 1 or 2 slim interior files, it's perfect."
1161,"Like all of the 3M inkjet label products I've sampled, I was well pleased with these. These are a nice weight. The sheets stay flat and feed easily, and the inverse cutouts from the die-cuts have been removed so the labels are very fast and easy to remove from backing. Good adhesive, nice weight. I've used the on plastic bags and paper, and they have a good hold, even in lower temperatures. I've preferred the 3M label products to both store brand & Avery. These work with Avery templates in Word.I'm using these small labels for retail price tags that don't require a removable label. They're large enough to include a description and a price."
1161,"I live in an old school full of dry erase boards, so I have a lot of old shadowy dry erase ghosting on the boards, so I was really excited to try a product capable of removing even permanent marker by just adding water, as these purport to do.They do not. You can scrub your butt off, but they won't even remove old dry erase, much less permanent marker.The only thing they will remove is fresh dry erase, which you can already remove with anything from a kleenex to the side of your hand. Total bust."
1161,"The envelopes themselves are pretty standard weight and paper quality--not at all fancy, but not thinner than average, either. They do a particularly good job of concealing the contents--even a retina-searing day-glow post it was well hidden, and checks are no problem. What makes these envelopes great is that they seem to be pretty tamper-proof. The adhesive is VERY sticky and seals immediately, and the flap is scored like an old-fashioned price tag, so there's no way to get inside without destroying the flap. This is actually probably why the cheaper mid-weight paper makes more sense than a heavy paper, which would be less prone to tearing under stress.The cool thing about the adhesive is that it is concealed by the envelope itself until you're ready to use it. This is great because you don't end up with those annoying paper strips all over your office if you're doing a big mailing, but you don't have to lick envelopes or worry about high humidity sticking them together before you use them up.An excellent version of the classic security envelope. The seemed expensive to me, but I looked at the office supply big box stores, and these are pretty on par for similar products, so 5 stars!"
1161,"Since you can still only see the same portion of any given tab when they're in the filing cabinet, I'm not sure I see the point of the comically oversized tab. Filed, they're no taller and have no more visible surface area than any of my normal folders.It is a nice sturdy folder, for a folder with an unreinforced tab. In general, though, I think for a reusuable folder, it makes more sense to go with the double-thickness tab style folder instead of a heavyweight single.But these are far superior to the bargain bin lightweight file folders, so if you're a GTD fan and like a big stack of plain folders, these are a good choice."
3261,"These are thick.  I am using them as chapter tabs in a textbook, and I like the way they look.  Ballpoint pen ink glides on smoothly too.Product details from packaging are as follows:2"" x 1-1/2"" NoteTabs-turns pages like a divider-made extra thick for reliable, long-lasting use-won't damage documents or lift ink (results may vary...)Made in China (Personally, I consider shipping these from China to be a huge negative, hence the loss of a star.)"
3261,"These are very nice labels that come in a pack with three different colors: light blue, light green, and yellow.  They have a little removable tab on the end so that when you pull them off the stack you don't crinkle the label trying to lift it off.  They don't have an extremely sticky feel to the back of them, however, they do stick to the file folders nicely.They are not for printers or typewriters.  These are for handwritten labels.  They are removable as the description states.  I tested this to make sure that after removing the labels several times they would still stick the next time I tried to use them, and it always worked.The only reason I gave them 4 stars was because I tend to write directly on my file folders if I'm going to write by hand.  Additionally, for me personally, I never reuse a label.  I'm not sure why I would ever want to do that, and I do work in a office job."
3261,"I've become a big fan of these tape strips.  They are particularly useful when gift wrapping.  The pre-cut pieces are the perfect size for wrapping presents.The dispenser is nice, because you simply open it up, drop the tape refill in, close it up, and it's ready to use.The color I received was a lime green shade.  I'm definitely not a fan of the color.It is a little bit tricky to get the dispenser to secure to the desk with the suction bottom, but once it's on it stays down pretty well.  It's plastic, so probably not the most durable dispenser on the market."
3261,"It has a single-touch opener on the bottom with a D-ring binder ring which claims to be spill-free.  The packaging also claims that it has a never-gap ring, which is likely the case with D-ring binders of any type, as long as it's not over-stuffed.  It has four inside ""pockets"":  two in the front and two on the inside-back cover.  It also has the slots on the side and the front with a clear cover that allows you to insert labels on the side and front.  What I like about the clear coating on the cover is that it has a matte finish.  Many of the clear covers are more glossy, but this one is different.If you're looking to purchase these online, I would recommend purchasing them in bulk if you need more than one.  I received one in a very large cardboard box."
3261,"These tabs are very nice and heavy weight.  They are easy to write on.  The ink glides on very smooth.  The pink is very bright, and surprisingly the blue is a little more muted or flat.  Both colors are very nice.The downside for me is that they are SO thick.  You could have twice as many in a pack if they weren't so thick.After using these tabs for a while, they have really grown on me.  They are especially useful for school books.  I took an MBA course recently, and they helped me keep things organized.  I've used the tabs as permanent dividers, although they could be used in other ways.  They did not appear to lift any ink on my textbooks when I moved them around.Here are the product details:Avery NoteTabs (16293), Durable & Repositionable40 per pack, 2"" x 1-1/2""Made in China-turns pages like a divider-made extra thick for long-lasting use-won't damage documents or lift ink-works with most writing instruments"
3261,"These flags are a smaller version of the ones I'm used to using and I just love them.  They are great for marking chapters in a textbook or to keep organized with my work.  All of the colors are basic shades, except the blue which is more neon.There is a Box Top on the back of the package.A note on the package states that the adhesive may mark some surfaces or lift inks and to test before using.The Avery product number is #22569."
3261,"This sticky tape/glue dot dispenser is a scrapbooker's delight!  It goes right on the back of a photo in a very defined movement, unlike the gluesticks that just seem to go everywhere.  No more curling pages and photos.  This item will have your photos sticking like a charm with no curling edges.I was skeptical at first (dots...who knew), but then I tried it and voila!  Perfect adhesion, and the dispenser is refillable so when I run out, I can pop in a refill roll and be on my way.The concept is like double-sided tape, but it's little dots of glue that roll onto your desired surface.  There are instructions on the back of the package that had me moving along in no time."
3261,"The colors are nice, but the 3"" tab is a bit too long for anything I would want to use these for.  The colors are great, and the ink glides on nicely.  The product claims not to lift the ink on your pages, and they are reusable.Avery NoteTabs 3 x 1.5 inches, pastel blue and yellow.36 per pack (16300)Loss of 1 star, because these are shipped from China.Loss of another star because they are too long for my needs.Made in China."
3261,"I am rating Smead FasTab Hanging Folders with Built-in Tabs, No. 64054.  The box came with 18 letter size 1/3 cut tabbed folders in assorted colors (light blue, light green, and light brown).  You can write directly on the tabs, which I recommend doing in pencil so you can erase and reuse them as necessary.  They seem fairly sturdy, are made in the USA, and contain a minimum of 10% post-consumer recycled content.  Given that the side of the box is labeled ""Smead Organomics"" you'd think the recycled content would have been higher.  I'm a little bit disappointed in that aspect, but overall they are nice folders, and they look crisp and clean in my desk drawer.  One desk file drawer used up 12 of the 18 folders, so if you're looking to replace all of the hanging file folders in your entire desk, keep that in mind."
3261,"These are retractable highlighters that are closed via a ""safety seal"" when retracted so the highlighters don't dry out.  The points are rather fine, and the colors are great.  They have a ""smear guard"" so they don't smear the words on your pages.  There's a purplish-blue shade that's too dark to function as a decent highlighter, in my opinion, but for certain purposes it may be useful.  There's no smelly odor with these, and best of all, they have a handy little case that holds them when they're not in use.Package says, ""Just click and highlight!""Love these!The eight colors are: red, orange, yellow, green, aqua blue, indigo blue, hot pink, and pink.(Made in China.)"
3261,These products were obtained for personal use on my child's white board. They seem to work just fine and have held up fine over the last couple months of use.
3261,"I didn't see the word ""opened"" in red like the listing indicates.  However, the glue stuck like superglue, and when I opened the envelope I had to tear it apart because it was stuck so securely.  Hence, it was evident that someone had opened it...there was NO hiding it.The envelopes have the security lining inside.  No moistening or tear strips...just unfold the area over the glue, put the flap down and you're done.I wouldn't personally go out of my way to get these envelopes over some other security envelope, but they do the job as far as my needs are concerned."
3261,"What can I say...a file folder is a file folder.  These are decent weight and have nicely sized third cut tabs.  They are ""primary"" colors.  Blue, red, yellow, and green.  There is nothing fancy about them but there's nothing to complain about either."
570,"Pen arrived in a gift box with a fabric lining.  Seemed fancier than I was expecting for this pen - considering the cost.  The pen itself is quite heavy which is nice.  The animal print though seems a little misplaced.  It's not terrible but it seems like it doesn't match the pen to me.The ink comes out smooth and fine.  No globby messes.  It's very nice to hold and use.The cap comes off and sticks on the back so you don't lose it when writing, however make sure you put that on securely or it whips off the end.  That isn't the fault of the pen, it's my fault for not pushing it on harder."
570,"Usually I use the Avery Brand of labels, and when these came I was so excited to see that they have printed the compatible Avery label number right on each sheet. These particular labels correspond to Avery 5366. This makes it so easy to use with Microsoft Word.These labels are the perfect size for labeling file folders, but can also be used for return address labels.  They measure 2/3"" tall x 3 7/16"" wideAnother plus for the 3M brand is that the labels are on the page but there is no sticker ""border"" around each label. I like this feature because it makes the labels pull off smoother. It also seemed to work well in the printer. None of the labels came off mid print, which you might think would happen. This was not the case. I prefer these sheets to the Avery sheets for this reason.The color was a nice bright white, the adhesive is great, and it worked with my labels I had saved on the computer in an Avery format."

I like this feature because it makes the labels pull off smoother. It also seemed to work well in the printer. None of the labels came off mid print, which you might think would happen. This was not the case. I prefer these sheets to the Avery sheets for this reason.The colors are bright, the adhesive is great, and it worked with my labels I had saved on the computer in an Avery format.There are 3 blue sheets (30 labels per sheet), and 4 sheets of the Pink, Yellow and neon Green.  I'm not sure why they couldn't just add a 4th blue sheet.These would be great for labeling when you really want your labels to be visible/noticed.  It sure beats coloring these in with a highlighter (which is what I used to do before I saw these)."
570,"These label pads are an excellent idea for the person who likes to organize, but also likes to reuse the same containers and doesn't like picking off old sticker labels (what a pain).  This product is a perfect solution.The usable portion of the label is a perfect size at about 3"" wide by 2"" tall.  There is a non-stick gripping area so labels are easy to pull off, easy to stick with no mess.  And they do stick well, yet when you are ready to remove them they come up in one piece like magic.Bright neon pink and green colors are nice.  No more boring white labels or pieces of grey duct tape with writing on it (Like I used to do)  Very eye-catching and appealing.Works well with sharpies, or any ink really.  Sticks to plastic and metal.  Probably not the best for wood, unless the surface was smooth.I highly recommend this item."

570,"I liked these tab ideas a lot.Sometimes when reading a book or manual it is nice to be able to tab the pages so that you can have a quick reference.  You can write on the tabs with pen, pencil or sharpie, as well as reposition them on the page or remove them with out destroying the page it was stuck to, or lifting the print that was on the page.  This is such a nice feature.I also liked the fact that the adhesive part was clear, so you can read any print through it.  That was a nice touch.I can even see using these in place of the tabbed divider sheets, as a time saver.They will not go through a printer, so if you wanted them to have a more professional feel to them you'd have to make a label for them separately, but I don't think these are meant as a replacement for all instances of tabbed dividers.The bright colors are nice and stand out well against almost anything you'd be using this for.A+ Avery product."
570,"These are really cool for the person who wants to mark pages in books, but so much better than your average book mark or sticky note.Durable, these will not rip and tear as easily as a regular sticky noteSee through, you can highlight or write notes right on your tab in the 3 x 3"" space and still see the text underneath.The tab part is great for easy reference.Sticky - just as sticky as the post it notes you are used to, and you can move these and re-stick them too.The only thing that I might like to see is the post it note part be clear instead of colored, but that is such a minor detail."
570,"My assessment can be summed up thus: Good alternative to messy glue sticks, but not as strong as regular liquid or gel glues.Here is why I like this product:1. NO MESS this is key.  It is so much less mess than a glue stick.  Even liquid glues can be messy2. Easy to use3. good for light paper projects4. storage is easy, glue doesn't dry out or leakHere are the cons:1. Not as strong as liquid or gel gluesThis product would be especially good for scrap booking or school poster projects."
570,"The first thing I noticed is that on the label sheets they were kind enough to include the corresponding Avery Template number that is used with Microsoft word.  (These correspond with the Avery 5366 label template.)  That made it super easy for me to work with using my computer.I printed up a sheet of these labels and they print just like any other laser label, so no discernible differences there.  When I tested them out though, this is where the difference was apparent.  I stuck them on plastic surfaces and paper, thin and thick.  Each time they stuck on tight but peeled off easily.  And more than once even.  I re-stuck the same label 4 times and it still stuck really well.  I could have put it on an envelope and mailed it and it seems like it would have stayed put.  To me that is really cool.These would be excellent for the person who wants to reuse files but doesn't want to stick labels over top of old ones, or for the person who has a project where maybe you have to change tags around on something.  But they work really well as standard labels too - they don't come off unless you try to peel them off.I think these are pretty amazing.  I will be using them a lot."
570,"These are great for holding lots of file folders in your file cabinets.  Sturdy construction.  Unlike some that just have paper bottoms, these have reinforced cardboard inserts that you can add to the bottoms for support.  I really like that because with the cheaper ones, they make a ""U"" shape over time and sag - dragging the bottom of the file cabinet.The material the folders are made out of is also more sturdy than others I have seen so these will last longer.  And the color (mint green) is much more pleasing than the basic pea soup/puke green ones that you see so often.I highly recommend these, they will last for years of repeated use."
570,"Usually I use the Avery Brand of shipping labels, and when these came I was so excited to see that they have printed the compatible Avery label number right on each sheet. These particular labels correspond to Avery 5667.

This was not the case. I prefer these sheets to the Avery sheets for this reason.The color was a nice bright white, the adhesive is great, and it worked with my labels I had saved on the computer in an Avery format.These particular sheets are designed for return addresses, with 80 labels per sheet you really get your money's worth on these, the labels are smallish and could be used for a variety of other labeling purposes other than return addresses.  Their size is about 1/2"" by 1 3/4""."
570,"When I got this I wondered how well it would work as compared to the ""magic eraser"" foam cleaning pads that I normally use when I am cleaning my white boards.  It works every bit as well because I think that the white portion of this eraser is actually made of the same stuff.  I can't be 100% sure but they feel and act a lot alike.  The directions even say for stubborn stains to wet this just like you would the magic eraser.  When doing the wet cleaning, I do have to finish with a paper towel just to get the extra residue but other than that it's pretty good results.The advantage to this product over just buying a bunch of magic erasers is that this is 2x larger than the small magic eraser rectangles, and it has the blue sponge gripper portion to hang on to without having your fingers drag along the surface as well when cleaning.  Also the shape is nice for fitting in ones hand.  The magic erasers without the blue handle thing attached will tend to ""compact"" more with use so I think this one with the extra blue part should last longer, or that is my impression anyway.As far as cleaning goes - it cleans as well as anything but it isn't perfect.  I have yet to find anything that is so that is why I give it 5 stars.  I still have ""Ghost"" images on my white board but nothing I have ever found has ever taken them out so I'm not going to hold that against this product, since I don't think there is anything that exists that will take them out."
570,"These envelopes are a standard legal size, no window, security envelope that you do not have to lick in order to seal.They have a self adhesive strip that you fold up part of the envelope to reveal then press the top flap down onto it.  This is good for the person who hates licking envelopes, and doesn't like the idea of having to peel off a paper label to reveal the glue (which is extra waste).They are not at all see through which is a must when sending checks or other items you may not want to be seen through a standard white envelope.The only drawback I see is some of these envelopes I have found are a little hard to reveal the sticky portion, but it wasn't so difficult that I wasn't able to use them or that I ripped any in the process.These might not be good if you are mailing over 50 letters at a time as the lifting flap to reveal the gluey part is a little time consuming as compared to licking envelopes or using a hand held envelope moistener.  But for the occasional letter or bill these are very nice."
570,"These are just the greatest little dispensers!  Let me run down why I love them:* Easy to install, and uninstalls without leaving a mark on your wall.* Installs anywhere you have a flat surface.  Texture doesn't appear to be an issue, so long as the tape can make contact reasonably well.* Fun bright colors* Sticky notes stay in place and don't wiggle around.* Notes dispense easily, one at a time every time.* No more misplaced post its when you urgently need them!* Pen holder is built right in too, so you won't be at a loss for a pen when you need it either!I really see no drawbacks to these at all.  You will just need to remember to refill them not with the standard post-its in book form, but the kind that peel off accordion-style."
570,"This is just the thing to have right by the phone.  Substantial size, pretty colors.  Great for all those phone messages you need to take down.  No more searching around for scratch paper.These are no different than regular post-it notes, just bright and colorful in a larger stack so they won't run out as fast.Very nice product."
694,"For gift wrapping & other instances where you'd like tape to not be so visible, this stuff is great!  I've actually used it on wooden picture frames & wooden press board furniture that had dents in it to just help maintain integrity.  There's probably a better fix, but it works for me.  Scotch knows how to make tape & this tape is no exception."
694,"These NoteTabs are easily removable, yet they are strong enough to stay in place while you turn to the page they are marking.  The tabs themselves are nice and thick.  I like that the entire side facing up can be written on, not just the colored tab portion.  I wrote on them with a pencil and was able to erase as well.  The only downside I can think of for these is that only one side of the tab can be written on.  Not a big deal for me.  I think these are great!"
694,"These are handy little labels.  I really like that these are made from recycled materials.  The packaging states that they were made from 80% post consumer paper.  I find it convenient that these are so compact, as the labels are stacked on top of each other like Post-It notes are.  I'd compare the adhesive characteristic of these labels to mimic those of Post-It notes.  They're don't have a terribly strong stick to them, but will stay there and will come off when you want them too.  It's nice that the whole label back is sticky rather than just a bar of stickiness found with your typical Post-It note.  These are neat little things."
694,I tried these out last week to make address labels and they worked perfectly with my Microsoft software. I used the Avery compatible number and made individual labels with the row/column selector and had no trouble at all. They do have a strong stick and won't remove easily which makes them great for shipping!
694,"I got the baby blue binder which is so cute.  My daughter is using it for school.  She hasn't had any problems with the rings not being aligned properly.  She is in third grade and I like that she can open and close the rings easily on her own.  The plastic hinges where the binder cover is meant to open and close appear to be more durable than standard binders we've owned in the past, although time will tell, we are happy for now.UPDATE: Although the rings appear to be aligned correctly, when my daughter tries to flip 15 or so pages at a time, they get snagged on the rings.  This is a bit irritating, but we haven't had the rings popping open when they get caught, which is good."
694,"I would describe these as labels with stick similar in feel to a post-it note's adhesive but with more stick.  I like that they can go straight through the printer with an Avery compatible number.  You get four different colors in a pack which is handy for organizing or color-coding.  These are good for labeling something non-permanently.  They remove very easily, yet stay in place well until you want to take them off."
694,This dispenser provides a convenient way to take post-it notes on-the-go.  It is easy to use and the post-it notes pop up without getting stuck.
694,I would describe these as labels with stick similar in feel to a post-it note's adhesive but with more stick.  I like that they have a non-stick tab on the edge that is perforated for easy removal.  These are good for labeling something non-permanently.  They remove very easily.
694,I tried these out this week to make return address labels and they worked perfectly with my Microsoft software to create adorable Christmas labels.  I used the Avery compatible number on my setting and had no trouble at all.  They do have a strong stick and won't remove easily which makes them great for going through the mail!
694,"The hinge on this 1"" binder feels well constructed and I have high hopes that it will last. The rings also close tightly and pages don't tend to get caught on them while being turned. With my larger 2"" Wilson Jones binders that have the single touch closure, the pages tend to get caught on the rings, but these rings are so small that I don't tend to have problems. The rings are very easy to open and close with just one hand. I feel that the cover is stiff enough to hold up, also. Finally, I love that the rings are mounted on the back cover rather than on the spine so that my pages stay nice and flat while in use.  Overall, this is a durable binder with easy to open rings that would be ideal for people with arthritis or young students with small hands."
694,"These flags from Avery are handy for bookmarking. I like that this pack of five pads comes with five separate colors. Also, they can be repositioned easily. The package states that the adhesive may mark some surfaces or lift inks. I personally have not experienced these problems. I like to use these is in situations where I do not need to write on the flags. I prefer Avery paper page markers if I need to write on them. The flags are more likely to smudge when written on but are more durable than paper.Each package includes a Box Tops for Education coupon.As a side note, these are made in China."
694,"For multi-purpose uses, Scotch makes the best tape out there.  It bonds well, but isn't too difficult to remove, either.  It's great that it can be written on, as well.  This is a sturdy tape that does the job well."
694,"These NoteTabs are easily removable, yet they are strong enough to stay in place while you turn to the page they are marking. The tabs themselves are nice and thick.

One downside I can think of for these is that only one side of the tab can be written on. Not a big deal for me, though.  Finally, I don't have the need for it to be so incredibly long.  I'm a little confused as to why they would need to be this long.  They are awkwardly long for me, but the nice thing is that they can be easily shortened due to their perforations along the tab.  They are easily customizeable for the task at hand.  I ultimately prefer the shorter NoteTabs by Avery for my purposes."
694,"I love how this machine heats up so quickly.  Also, it's easy to notice on the display that the machine is ready.  It really is ready when it says it's ready and laminates your sign or document to a glossy finish.  I used Scotch Thermal Laminating Pouches with the machine and it worked like a charm.  It couldn't have been easier to get professional looking results!As a side note, the first time I used the machine, I did use it out in my garage since the instructions said it would smell the first time.  It did, so I'm glad I used it out there.UPDATE: I got the dreaded E4 error message with the annoying beeping noise after laminating something the other day.  I googled it and rather than calling customer service, which I felt too busy to do, I did what I read about online, which was unplug the unit and plug it back in.  Voila!  Error message gone.  I hope that doesn't happen too often."
694,"I had no issues with getting this loaded with the tape.  Once loaded, it was easy to use & sped up the packaging process.  The handle is comfortable to grip.  I'm not sure how I'll feel about the hassle of trying to find replacement tape rolls at an affordable price since I haven't run out of tape yet.  It is something to consider & is why I knocked off one star."
694,"These perform their function well and are made in the USA, which I like, but I must say I prefer the Avery NoteTabs better.  They are cheaper & thicker.  These are durable, but I do like my tabs to be thicker than this.  I don't really have a good reason for it, I just do.  Overall, I really like this type of product and use them all the time to keep my place in books.  These keep my place in the book without any worries of it falling out like a traditional bookmark.  The stickiness allows it to stay put.  These are really handy."

I'm a little confused as to why they would need to be long.  I prefer the shorter NoteTabs by Avery for my purposes.  Overall, a handy little produce by Avery."
694,I tried these out today and they worked perfectly with my Microsoft software to create nice return labels. I used the Avery compatible number on my setting and had no trouble at all. They do have a strong stick and won't remove easily which makes them great for going through the mail!  They are small-just the right size for a return address label.
694,"These couldn't be easier to use!  Just lift the flap to expose the adhesive & seal.  I love that there's no licking, sponging, or wetting of any kind involved.  There isn't even anything to throw away as the flap stays attached.  These are especially convenient for someone who does a great deal of stuffing envelopes.  Great product!"
694,"This handy binder appeals to me in several ways.  I like The clear pockets on the outside cover & side that I can use to insert labeling information.  I also love the ""lay flat"" design of the rings.  The rings are on the flat surface of the back panel rather than on the side, making page turning a breeze.  As far as the ""durable"" label goes, I think all binders should be made to at least this strength, which is sufficient for my needs.  Finally, it's also nice to have two inside pockets on the front & two on the back.  It's a nice large size, being advertised to hold up to 500 sheets, which will vary, of course, based on the thickness of the paper you're inserting.  Great binder!"
694,"These paper page markers from Avery are handy for bookmarking. I like that this pack of five pads comes with five separate colors. The paper is easy to write on and they can be repositioned easily. The package states that the adhesive may mark some surfaces or lift inks. It also states that the colors may bleed when wet. I personally have not experienced these problems.Each package includes a Box  Tops for Education coupon.I just wish these were made from recycled materials. As a side note, these are made in China."
573,"A bit on the thin side, and they are see-thru (so don't try to recycle it by using the other side for a new label, unless you put white paper behind it.)  That they are ""removable"" is convenient if you have to change your tab dividers from time to time, but after several uses, they don't always stick so well anymore.I personally didn't find I had much use for them, since if I stick on a tab divider, I usually plan on it staying there indefinitely.  I use the permanent tabs more often."
573,"When I am going to wrap gifts, this is the tape I grab. It's not shiny, so it virtually disappears when put on the gift wrap. Scratching gently on it using a thumb nail or credit card causes greater adhesion, which makes it practically invisible. That's why they call it ""magic.""It cuts off easily with the dispenser.The dispenser is durable.Other brands I have tried tend to split when I try to tear off a piece. This can render the whole roll of tape useless once you lose the ""end"".It's been doing a great job on gift wrap for years.no complaints, except that it keeps disappearing around my house- the kids use it for EVERYTHING."
573,"Finally! A tape gun that doesn't way a ton, won't take up a whole lot of space in a drawer, and won't stick to everything in the drawer because of exposed tape!  Just press the buttons to lift up the cover and change the tape. The tape roll simply pops in for easy changing. You have to pull out a little bit of tape to get it started, but once that's done, you are ready to go. I love it!This tape gun, er, I mean ""dispenser,"" is nice and light, and works just like you would expect any tape gun to work, only better.  The grip is comfortable and soft. It takes smaller rolls of tape (about half the diameter size of a regular tape gun roll) but they are almost completely enclosed in the unit.  You can put this fully loaded tape ""dispenser"" in a drawer and not have to worry about tape sticking to everything else in the drawer.  I've used to to close up boxes for shipping, and it worked like a dream.I also don't have to worry about the teeth on the ""cutter"" part scraping up skin, or insides of drawers, as the teeth on this one are smaller and shorter, therefore less hazardous. They still cut through the tape just fine, even though the tape used is thicker than a normal tape gun's tape.I can't find anything to complain about with this tape dispenser."
573,"I have many other types of dry erase markers I have used. This brand of markers might be okon a white dry erase board, but it didn't come across very well on a blue one we have.We have several dry-erase boards. We have one we use almost every day that has a 3-D blue design for its background. These markers aren't dark enough, bright enough, opaque enough or however you want to say it- to make it easy to read.The lines it leaves aren't exactly crisp either- meaning the edges can look a bit blurry for folks whose eyes don't focus as well anymore- like mine.  I tried all the colors. I don't know why companies even make yellow markers since I can't see them well on any surface.So while these will work, they really could have been made easier to read."
573,"Scotch brand is known for its adhesives.  This ""dot roller"" puts out a strip of sticky flat dots rather than one simple ribbon of double-stick tape.  It still works pretty much the way you would expect it to.I used it to attach photos to paper, and it did a nice job of adhering the photos to the paper permanently."
573,"These plastic tabs are sticky on one side (like a post-it note) and can be written on by any writing tool.  Very sturdy and stiff, yet inexpensive enough to be thrown out if you need to change them."
573,"The most noticable difference between this product and other ""tab"" dividers is their shape. I find that I much prefer the half-circle tabs to the rectangular ones.  This was a great design change! I find them much easier to grab, and more aesthetically pleasing.I hope they'll start making them in more vibrant colors as well."
573,"3M has never been a company to disappoint me when it comes to adhesives.Pros:VERY stickyPERMANENTlarge enough to hand write an address on them if neededCan print on them with your computer to make name tags and such.one thing to note: They come on a sheet, not a roll, so they are not for Dymo type printers."
573,"You can't use regular roll-type tape refills with this item, of course. It uses special sized tape segments that come pre-packaged.  It does have sort of a gripper on the bottom, but it's not a suction type that would stick on a vertical surface.Turns out, they do supply a small pack of the special tape segments you need to use for this dispenser.  It's so small though, it's easy to overlook inside the dispenser. Apparently my tape packet fell out when I opened it, and I never found it again.  Of course, it's going to cost a pretty penny to get more of those special tape packets, and they seem to go pretty quick.While a convenient idea, the added cost of the tape packets means it will only be used in my house for special occasions (like when I'm wrapping a lot of gifts over the holidays.)  I'll have to keep it hidden from my creative children who like to put everything together with tape!  Not very practical in that regard, but definitely helpful when I only have one hand free to get a piece of tape."
573,"Tired of grabbing several Post-it notes when you only want one?  Here is your answer. The holder prevents more than one piece of paper coming out at a time. It doesn't ""pop up"" at you, but it works.This dispenser turned out to be very helpful for my elderly, arthritic parent who has difficulty grabbing small things.  We use it by simply laying the plastic holder on its back, taking the notes from the front. The plastic holder can be mounted with velcro to any wall, using the ""removable"" 3M sticky things. You could also stand it upright, but it would probably require two hands to get a note that way; one to hold the dispenser, one to grab the note.When you put in the pad of Post-it notes, make sure the first one is half way out of the dispenser front.  The Post-it notes have the adhesive edge alternate from one side of the square of paper to the other side, and back again. Because of the ""accordion"" style stickiness on the backs, each one will separate as you pull them out of the dispenser.Sort of hard to explain, but it works!"
573,"I'm not really sure when I would have a use for these.  They are bright pink and green stickers, in a 2 x 3 rectagle shape (basically).Post-it decided to stack them all up on top of each other rather than spread them out like most labels.  I find it a bit difficult to get them apart.If I try to pull one sticker off, instead I get about 8 of them.  Trying to put the stack back together is no easy trick.  If the stack isn't put back together perfectly lined up, dust and other stuff collects on the exposed adhesive over time, making it less sticky, of course. You have to try and separate them by using the thin strip of ""perforated"" area on the sticker that has no adhesive.  This strip is about 4th of an inch thick, which I find too small.The stickers are rather thick, so I always think I'm getting more than one.  This can be frustrating.If you need plain bright pink or green rectangular stickers, these are it.If you don't have a lot of time to spend peeling apart stickers, then pass on these and get the plain white kind that come in a sheet.  You can print any color or message you want on those."
573,"You wouldn't think there is much difference between mailing labels, until you have encountered some of the ""not so great"" ones; the kind that don't really stick and peel back at the corners before you get to the post office, the kind that are so sticky and thin that they rip or tear when you try to get them off the page, or the kind that someone thought would be good to stack up like pancakes rather than put them on a flat sheet...and the list goes on.No fuss here with 3M.  Their labels are the right thickness, the right stickiness, and they don't tear or rip as easily as others.  They are easy to write on, easy to stick to just about anything, and are consistently good products.3M has put thought into their products. Bravo!"
772,"The satin finish is supposed to make this more invisible than regular ""Magic"" tape when used on gift wrap.  To my eyes, there is almost no difference.  So the only reason to get this is if the price is better than regular ""Magic"" tape.  As I write this review, it is!To be clear, there's nothing WRONG with this tape.  It works just as well as regular ""Magic"" tape.  It's very hard to see when applied.  And, I assume, it'll have the same remarkable durability as regular ""Magic"" tape.  It's just that it's special feature (satin finish, more invisible on gift wrap) doesn't work."
772,"(review refers to the Large box)VERY strong construction.  clever, user-friendly features (windows, reinforced handles)Assembly is a bit trickier than with similar boxes I've used before.  The 2nd step, where you pop the box into it's full rectangular shape is annoying.  But other than that everything is straightforward.  The instructions (on an interior panel) are always visible while you're assembling so you won't get confused.  And it's much easier the 2nd time you do it.Looking at the picture you'd think those clever windows are sheets of thin cellophane - that they'd break or split open easily.  No!  That's a STRONG sheet of plastic inserted when you assemble the box.  Probably stronger than the thick cardboard the box is made of.The plastic handles are a good idea if you move the box a lot.  Without those, there would be a lot of wear on the handle edges.  If you store the box for a long time in a dusty area, stuff newspaper or tissue into the handle holes to keep out the dust."
772,"Summary.Comfortable, effective and a bit pricier than the competition.Gel filled pads feel better than foam pads.  This is a gel pad - good.The leatherette surface looks good and, surprisingly, didn't feel sticky even when I used it during a brutally hot and humid day.The non-skid base is NON-SKID.  You could anchor a boat with it.  But it's easy enough to lift the pad and move it around - you just can't slide it.  There's no adhesive to fuss about.The only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars is the suggested retail price of [...] bucks is a lot more than I'm willing to pay for wrist support.  But if the current selling price (whatever Amazon feels like charging at the moment) is ok with you then go for it.  This is a first class wrist rest."
772,"Here's something you might not know about this definitive tape.  It lasts a really long time!  In 1970 or 71 I made some scrapbooks of newpaper clippings.  I used Magic Tape to fix the clippings to paper backing.  Over 35 years later, the tape was still invisible and holding the clippings in place.  I had also used some non-magic cellophane tape - that was in bad shape after all that time.Why mess around?  Use the good stuff!  Use Magic Tape."
772,"These NoteTabs are a very specialized product BUT if you want to annotate a book, mark specific lines, have easy tabbed access to those sections AND you don't want to leave permanent markings - does Avery have a product for you!It's not a replacement for highlighters.  The NoteTabs are thicker than regular book paper - you won't be able to stick too many in one book without having the book bulge.  But highlighters don't have handy tabs sticking out so you can find the key text you wanted to note.The writing surface is a little too smooth.  But I was able to write legibly with both pen and #2 pencil.  Ink way take a while to dry.  If you close the page too soon you could have ink left on the opposite page.  Have a tissue handy to blot the ink.The adhesive sticks well.  If you put the NoteTab in, then take advantage of the see-through feature to underline some text, you won't have to worry about the NoteTab slipping up or down.  But the adhesive is loose enough so that it won't damage the paper IF you peel it off carefully.If you're lecturing and want to refer to a stack of books during the lecture - these will do the job.----------------  A few weeks later.  ---------------Found another good use for them.  I'm reading a book that has many maps scattered throughout the text.  I put a tab on each map, with the name of the map in pencil on the tab, and the book is MUCH easier to folllow now.  PLUS, when I finish the book I can peel off the tabs and use them for something else."
772,"It fulfills it's claims.Doesn't smear.MUCH easier to use than a capped highlighter.Chisel tip lets you underline or highlight (a bit clumsy to use, though)The seal prevents the tip from drying out when you unclick it (based on a few days use.  If I notice it drying out in the future I'll update this review)8 (eight!) brilliant colors in this pack.  Just the thing if you have some elaborate highlighting scheme in mind."
772,"Executive Summary - It's hard to find a use for these that other things don't do better.  And the product's flaws make it a questionable solution for things that you do use it for.These labels are fighting for space in the weakly adhesive note niche dominated by Post-It notes.  Avery's idea is to make a weakly adhesive note specialized for labels.Problem.  When you want to put a label on something, you want the label to stay there.  You can't rely on these labels to do that under normal conditions.  The part of the label on the opposite edge of the tear away tab curls up when you pull it off the pad.  Then, when you apply the label - that curled part will pull away by itself after a few minutes.  If you push it down, it pops right up again.  The adhesive is too weak to hold it down against the curl of the paper.  This happens on every surface (paper, cardboard, smooth plastic, rough plastic, painted wood) I tested except for clean glass.  This can be a problem if you have the label on a moveable item - like a file folder.  Put these labels on 10 file folders.  Lay those folders out on a desktop - move them around - let one slide over another.  Stuff you would actually do in the real world.  There's a good chance that curled up part will catch on another folder and peel right off.  Worse than useless!So you can only use these labels on things that don't move or come into contact with moving things - like sticking them on a wall or a chart.  But a Post-It note would work just as well in that situation.On the positive side, the labels are easy to write on.  When you pull them off there is no adhesive residue.  They look good.  Since they're not actually harmful, I can't give them a one star."
772,"Summary:  Fast and Easy but Scotch is trying to make sticky tape as expensive as printer ink!For most people, a generic office tape dispenser would be a better choice.  However, if you have a lot of stuff to stuck together with little pieces of tape then this does work well.I tested it vs. a generic office tape dispenser (rubber base, weighs about a pound).  I was able to complete my taping task in 50 seconds with the generic dispenser vs. 36 seconds with the Scotch pop-up.  On the other hand, if you have a LOT of things to stick together you'd have to refill the pop-up every 75 sticks.  And that's a clumsy process.The dispenser itself is very clever and well designed.  I haven't seen a rubber suction grip like that before.  It has very high resistance to upward pulls but almost none to sideways pressure.  So it's very easy to slide around on the desk but it remains secure when you're pull up a strip of tape.  (only works on smooth, clean surfaces).On the expensive to use part - a rough estimate is that these strips are 10-20 times more expensive than rolls of generic invisible tape.It's the normal trade off between convenience and cost.Scotch makes a similar dispenser that fits on a wrist bracelet.  It uses the same refills so if you like short strips of tape you can get both dispensers and use them appropriately."
772,"Regular post-it notes in a dispenser that sticks where you want it to be.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that a penny a page (for the refills) seems a bit pricy but only a little bit.I stuck 3 dispensers in various places.  I noticed that when I pulled the protective cover off the adhesive backing on one of the dispensers that the adhesive almost came off the dispenser - that is, the sticky stuff was sticking to the cover instead of the dispenser. I was able to push back down on the cover and peel the cover off again and left the adhesive where it was supposed to be but you might want to take note of this before applying a dispenser.In order to refill the dispenser you have to peel it off.  I imagine the adhesive might peel off the dispenser occasionally but if you stick the dispenser back in the same place it should still work.Assembling the dispenser the first time is confusing as the directions are underneath the adhesive - therefore you don't see them until the adhesive cover is removed."
772,"A typical post-it note has the slightly sticky adhesive on about 25% of it's back.  For example, a 3"" squarish note has adhesive on .75"" of it's back.  BUT, the 2900-PG is a 21st Century Miracle!  It has adhesive on 88% of it's back!  That's 255% more (linear) sticky!  (even higher if you tear off the perforated strip.  Then 100% of the back is sticky)Other than a dump for my spare exclamation marks, what's the point?  You can use these ""Super Sticky"" notes just like any other note.  BUT, they are also suitable for applications where things would rub against them.  That would pull off regular (20th century!) Post-its but wouldn't faze these modern marvels!Remove the perf strip, and the label stays on unless you want it to come off.Bonus!  Half the labels are bright green, half are shocking pink!Another Bonus!  Actual size is 3 3/8"" (3"" without the non-stick strip removed) by 2"" not 2 7/8"" by 1 7/8""."
772,"This dispenser is handy, attractive and useful.  And darned expensive to use based upon list prices at the time of this review.Handy.  Fits comfortably over the back of the hand or on the wrist.  Could wear it for hours without discomfort.Looks great.  Would even work as a stocking stuffer gift for someone who does a lot of shipping and wrapping and such.Useful.  (Assuming you use a lot of short strips of tape!) Hard to see how you can top this.However, based upon prices (not counting shipping) at the time of this review each tiny strip of tape costs almost a cent.  Seems like a lot.  But that's a decision each buyer is going to make based upon how much they'll be using this and how much refills cost from your supplier.  For example, if I were an office worker and the company pays for tape I'd certainly be using it.  But I'm not going to buy it for myself since I'm cheap!On the other hand, if you do a LOT of wrapping, then the time savings could make up for the expense."
772,"Executive Summary: Yes, it works just like it looks.It's a post-it note that's as long as you'd like.  The adhesive covers the full back so you get a more secure grip - a good idea if you using a tiny little piece or if you're putting the note on a place where it gets bumped from time to time.  This will hold where a regular post-it will flutter away.Like a regular post-it, the adhesive is not messy.Writing the note is a weak point.  If it's impractical to put the note in place before writing the text you'll have to either put the note somewhere else first to write (might lose some adhesive if you do that - put it on a clean, dry surface to keep adhesive loss to a minimum) or write while it's still on the roll.  Surprisingly, that works.  It's a little cramped for writing space.If you think that last point is very weak criticism, you're right.  There's little bad to say about the Post-It Roll.  It could replace Post-It pads most of the time - what else could make that claim?"
574,"I like this large pack of file folder labels.  They go through the printer well.  Since the package is large, I won't run out in the middle of a project.  They stick well and look great."
574,This binder is very durable and good looking. It keeps my papers organized and in a safe place where they can be located quickly and easily. The binder rings open and close smoothly and securely. I like the blue color. Very pleasing on the eyes when it is on the shelf with other binders. I highly recommend this binder.
574,"Nice to be able to put stickers on things and yet remove them when you want.  These work great.  Nice colors and sizes, too."
574,"I love pop up post its.  So convenient to use.  These can be attached to a laptop, monitor, desk, or anything that you need to have them be accessible and convenient.  Works great!  Love them!"
574,Great address labels you can print on.  I like having such a large package.  Won't run out in the middle of a print job.  This is a great product.
574,"The wrist rest is great.  I got it to use with my laptop, but since I have my laptop at an angle, I can't use the wrist rest.  Would probably work best with a desktop computer."
574,I feel you can never have too many Post-It note pads.  I love these pastel colors.  Easy to read what you've written on them.  They stick well and are a good size for a real note.  And there are quite a few in this package.  I highly recommend them.
574,The dots come off where you want them to and stay where you put them.  The roller is convenient to handle and use.  I think that everyone who does scrapbooking should own one.  Plus this would come in very handy for students putting together projects.
574,You can put a note tab on a folder or paper and then move it to another folder or paper or just change what's on the tab.  It is very versatile in the office or home setting.  Recommend them.
574,"Depending on the material you are putting on, they stick well.  I did have trouble with them on the magnets on my white board.  Won't stick to that at all.  But to other materials, they stick and remove just fine.  I like them."
574,These tabs are reusable and easy to use.  I recommend them for every job.
574,"I didn't look at this well before ordering.  The tabs are a part of the hanging folder, permanently.  So, using these in a drawer with regular folders with or without tabs doesn't work really well.  I like the folders themselves.  They are well constructed and hold a lot.  The permanent tab won't break or come off.  So, if you have a drawer that only has this type of folder, they would be great.  They aren't good for integrating into drawers with the old types of folders, too."
574,These are great labels and the size of the package is wonderful.  Aren't always running out of labels in the middle of a big job.
574,"I use a lot of notes in my business.  I like these because the bright bold colors make them easy to find and see.  They are easy to write on and stick up well.  There are quite a few in the package so you won't run out fast, either.  I highly recommend these sticky notes."
574,These envelopes seal tight and protect your information by not letting people see thru.  I really like them!
574,It's great having pop up notes on my desk.  Very convenient and functional.  It looks nice as well.  I recommend this to everyone for their office and for students.
574,"I use Post-It notes all the time.  There are notes all around my laptop screen.  Help me remember things.  I especially like the bring colors in this pack.  Makes the notes catch your attention.  They stick well, too.  I like the size as they're big enough for a quick note but not so big they're hard to find a place to put them up.  I highly recommend these."
574,"Easy to find a sticky note when you need one, even on a messy desk.  The colors are pleasing to the eye and you can readily write on them.  The notes stick well but don't mar surfaces.  I highly recommend these notes."
377,"3M has done it again! Another innovative and very useful product using Scotch Tape. How many times have you wrestled with a package that needed to be taped and attempted to juggle the box while you attempted to pull a length of tape off the dispenser to place on the package? I know I have had this problem many, many times and especially at Christmas with the flimsy wrapping paper. Well, 3M has solved the problem with the handheld dispenser that has a band to wrap around your hand. That's just half of the helpful things... the other half is a Deskgrip... this dispenser grips the surface of your desk or table and you simply lift the pre-cut strip. This handy package has two of each type of dispenser.. four in all... plus six pre-cut sets of tape strips refills. What a great convenience for the home or office."
377,"I have used Scotch Post-it tape for years now. I used it before I retired. The great thing is that it is very sticky (strong) and holds as long as you want it to. What I had been using was also one inch in a single sided plastic dispenser with a saw-tip ""ripper"". This new dispenser is much more attractive and is a bit easier to use. What I noticed immediately is that the ""old"" tape was 700 inches and this is 400 inches! There is at least one narrower version (at least in the old style dispenser) that is labeled ""one line"" (this is six line). That was also handy especially to cover up a line of typing. Back to this green 400""x1"" tape. It appears to be the same old Post-it tape that I came to depend on over the years except that it is green and since it is shorter, you'll need to go back for more sooner! I keep a roll next to my computer and one in my desk. If you are not familiar with Scotch Post-it tape and paper, this is a good way to start."
377,Seeing the 3M name helped me feel confident that these labels wouldn't detach from what I put in the mail. The downloadable templates were easy to use and now I can type a legible label for my packages or envelopes. I'm 75 years old and my handwriting is a challenge to the reader. These labels fill the bill nicely. They're also handy for labels to place in books to identify the owner in case someone borrows a book. You'll find numerous other uses for these since the size is not too small for information and not so large as to limit their use.
377,This nice Wilson Jones binder is listed as being an &#34;ultra duty&#34; binder. I can see nothing special that makes it an ultra duty binder! What I did see that was a real plus is the easy to open rings! I like &#34;D&#34; ring binders and this is a &#34;D&#34; ring binder. Another nice feature are the extra pockets inside of the covers. A nice well-made binder. I like it!
377,"I found these sticky notes to be very useful. The size is perfect and the colors are bright but not blinding! The added sticky strip is a bit up from the bottom of the sheet... that makes it easier to pick up and remove. It it was at or near the bottom, one would have a bit of a problem (and a delay if you are impatient) removing the sticky notes. The important thing is that the second strip of adhesive does help prevent curling. I like them!"
377,I don't know how I got along without these handy flags. One thing I really like are the different colors. I can easilyy identify different reasons for what I was identifying the page. I like them!
377,"These Post-it Filing Tabs are perfect for me. I use them at the top of pages in my ""Dummies"" books to easily reference pages that I refer to frequently. The assorted colors allow me to create a unique identification for things I need to find. I'm sure you'll find several uses for them. They are something that one wants to keep on hand. Even though I'm retired, I like to have a supply of office products available."
377,"These dot adhesive runners are the perfect solution to what one needs to adhere something without making a mess. I thought I had it all when I discovered white out tape. This product is similar but instead of laying down a white stripe, it applies a narrow dotted adhesive strip. Makes the job much easier than using a glue stick. This is a permanent adhesive... I discovered that there is also a ""removable"" dot adhesive runner. That would be handy to have on hand also. I believe that if you have a need to glue something, this is it! Ideal for scrapbooks, too."
377,"This Scotch Super Glue is what I've come to expect from 3M. Unlike the typical super glues that are in a tiny tube and often can be used only one time, this glue has an easy to hold dispenser/container that dispenses the glue very accurately. It bonds most everything. I like it and believe that you will also. Highly recommended!"
377,"I found these NoteTabs to be just what I wanted to use for my references. I like to mark important pages in magazines and books for quick reference and these do the job. Ofter, I mark pages in my computer ""Dummies"" books for use when I have a problem with my computer or a friend asks for help. I can quickly find the material using the sturdy note tab. I can also write a short note with additional information. And, they are re-useable. I like them!"
377,"These file folder labels are perfect! I have been a long-time user of Post-it notes and tape and this is a great addition to the line-up of Post-it products. You'll find 750 labels here... enough to last a long time. I often re-use file folders and these are perfect for use from making the first label until the last. They're also handy for use in my books. I can print labels with my name and address and place it inside the cover so if anyone borrows the book, they'll know it's mine! And, if I decide to sell the book, the label is easily removable. I'm sure I'll find many other uses for these removable labels as time goes by. They'll be perfect for use on Christmas gifts. I wrap the gifts and my wife affixes the name tag. With these removable labels, there'll be no mix ups!"
377,"These small labels are perfect! I use a lot of address labels and sometimes find that the label is larger than I would like. These are small enough to do the job. The package contains 2000 labels... enough to last a long time. I did notice one problem with these small (1-3/4""x1/2"") labels. Using MS Word and my HP inkjet printer, as the labels print down the page, the image area does not register with the label and some of the lower labels are not useable. Hint... if the information you are using on the label doesn't fit using MS Word's template, type the information on a ""regular"" Word page using whatever fonts and sizes you prefer, then copy and paste it in the label window. You can even place a small image on the label."
377,"These are really neat sticky notes. Different sizes, different colors! There are a nice supply on the pad so they should last for awhile. If I wasn't retired and still in the workplace, I wouldn't leave the pad on my desk for fear that someone would walk by and take the pad. They are very useful and attention-getters!"
377,"These Pop-up Notes add another dimension to Post-it notes. I've been a user of Post-it notes for a long time and always keep them handy. These Pop-up Notes have a nice dispenser that can be mounted on a wall or computer with the supplied Velcro-like fasteners. I gave on of them to my wife and am using the other on my computer desk. I found another use for the fasteners (shhh!). The well for the pen/pencil holder is a bit shallow to hold a regular ball point pen or pencil, though. These are a welcome addition and convenience for me. One of these on the refrigerator could be used for things to buy at the grocery store or a note to a family member."
377,These Avery page markers are exactly what someone needs when they wan't to create a reference to a page. I use them to mark pages in magazines and books. The various colors allow for different reasons to id the page. I like them!
454,"I wrap a lot of gifts at the holiday season.  I am more into wrapping with wrapping patterned paper than the expensive option of gift bags.  So I tend to be very picky when it comes to my paper and tape.  I love this tape, I've been buying it for a few years.  It is actually a little bit more shiny than the regular Scotch tape, but blends into wrapping paper better than regular Scotch tape.  I used to use the double stick tape, but that was getting too expensive, especially with the kids just ripping off the paper quicker than you can say ""boo"".  I am the one who cares so much about how the finished gift wrapping looks, yes I admit that.  But when giving a gift to someone other than my own family, looks do mean a lot.  I spent a lot of time deciding what to give this person, so when I wrap it, I want it to look like I care.  So I use this tape.I like to think that fingerprints don't seem to show as easily as regular Scotch tape, but that may just be wishful thinking.  It seems that with this Gift Wrap tape, the actual adhesive on the film is more microscopic so you can't see the texture like you do with regular Scotch tape.As far as the 3 roll thing, I much prefer to buy a regular roll and put it into a dispenser.  The flimsy dispenser that the rolls come in in the 3 roll pack are very basic.  The length of tape you get with the 3 roll pack is a lot shorter than a single roll, so if you have many gifts to wrap, then consider buying more of the single rolls.  Another reason you might like the single roll is because the serrated edge for the tape cutter is much more crude than a heavy desktop tape dispenser or even a regular plastic dispenser.  I prefer the weight of the desktop tape dispenser when wrapping a lot of gifts.  Its a bit easier to tear off the tape with that weight in it, and it's more of a one handed job than a two handed job."
454,"I was excited to try out my new set of colorful pens.  Before writing with them though, as with many other pens these days, there is a ""tip seal"".  This prevents the ink from drying out.  On the orange colored pen, the tip seal covered the entire tip of the pen case.  I still haven't been able to get all of the plastic out of the inside of the pen, so when I click the pen, it doesn't come out all the way without a lot of effort.Unrelated to this purchase, I recently emailed Paper Mate because of some other pens I had bought a few years ago.  I finally started to use them, and two out of three of them didn't work.  I went to the Paper Mate website and found that I could only contact customer service via email.  I did so, and only received some weird form-letter response that didn't even match my query.  On the back of this package, it says there is an InkJoy guarantee.  They list a mailing address to ""drop them a line"" if you have an issue and they will ""make it right"".For less than $5, I would say yes, these are fine.  8 different colors (including two ordinary colors of blue and black).  I hope yours work though, since their customer service isn't that great."
454,"As a office-supply fanatic, I had to try these things out.  They are like Post-Its, but different in that the entire back surface is sticky.  Not so sticky that you can't remove it, but sticky enough for it to stay on most things without peeling off.I used these labels to put ""I love you"" notes on my daughter's lunch container, and to label a frozen batch of chicken broth in a plastic container in my freezer.  Also I used these labels to put a note on a book as a quick identification before sending it to summer camp with my daughter.These labels don't take place of my beloved Post-Its, but are a great addition to my collection of office supplies. Also, the price is right for these labels.  120 labels should last a while"
454,"As an office-supply junkie, I know a lot about printing labels.  I remember less than ten years ago, these silly labels didn't even reference the template/label number that they are formatted for, so I would have to go and look at the box or cardboard envelope that they came out of to remind myself.  Well, things have evolved.  These labels have all of the information you need printed on the perimeter of each label page.  These labels are compatible with the Avery 5163 labels, and you get 10 (2 columns of 5) labels per sheet.  Avery seems to have had a lock on the printer-label market, but perhaps 3M can change that.  One nice thing about these labels is that you can buy a smaller amount without spending a fortune.  Less than $10 for 25 sheets of 10 labels, which should last the average person quite a while.  I store my packets of printer labels in a plastic box with a lid, and these fit right in there with the rest of them.The print on the labels looks crisp; I used an HP laser printer.  And I used my usual toner-saver mode, and the print still looked good.  These labels do stay adhered to a cardboard box, which is pretty good, because usually they seem to peel up a little for no good reason.  However, before I send out my holiday packages, I am sure I will put clear packing tape over it so the address does not get water damage.Now, if you are a bit nervous about printing your first labels, don't worry.  Print out your test page on plain white paper.  Then hold the label sheet behind the test page up to the light, and you will be able to tell if your print job will fit on the labels or not.So I do highly recommend these labels for your everyday needs.  Happy Holidays!"
454,"These little labels are great for labeling things in your pantry or office, or maybe your toiletry cabinet.  And a thousand other useful ways too!  I use them in all of the places I listed.  Very handy and easy to peel off, if I want to.One weird thing is that they don't explain on the package what the dotted line is for.  That small part of the piece of paper is not sticky.  It looks like its supposed to be perforated, but when I tear it off, it is definitely not perforated, and the paper is torn up.These sticky notes come in a nice re-closeable zip bag.  A nice feature because you want to make sure you can find your sticky notes when you need them!"
454,"I am instantly in love with these labels!  Often I buy things online, and once in a while, have to return them.  Then comes the annoying task of trying to peel off the original packing label from the box, which never comes off quickly or easily.  Enter these labels.  Simply print your return label on one of these, and just stick it over the original label.  Since this label is grey on the backside (but not black in the core), what Avery calls ""TrueBlock Technology"" - it covers the original label and original bar code stuff that messes up the UPS/other delivery service readers.The only funny thing I can say about these labels is that the template number is not on the label sheet.  The template number is 8126, which is easy enough to find on the package.  The labels (2 per sheet) take up all of the space on the 8 1/2""x11"" sheet, so perhaps there was just no room.  However there is information printed on the back of the sheet, telling us about Avery's free tips, templates and software.  It's all good though.  Just remember to keep the package nearby when you get your label going on the computer if you are typing up your own thing, and not using pre-generated label from the website you are returning to.These labels are made for ink jet printers, but I used it on my laser printer, and it was perfect."
454,"Office supply junkie here.  Yes this is really fun stuff!  I use this adhesive paper tape for all kinds of things.  I keep a roll in my kitchen pantry so I can label stuff that I put in the freezer.  Things like ""1 cup chicken broth"" when I freeze it in a plastic container.  This tape is great for labeling things for your kids also.  It is easily removable and you can write on it with a permanent pen or whatever you chose.  I have some of this up in my daughter's bathroom to remind her of her morning routine.  Not that she needs it anymore, but it is still up there. The possibilities are endless!It is not plasticized, it is just like a Post-it note paper but all adhesive.  If you need plasticized tape check out a Brother P-Touch machine.  I have those also!"
454,"I am one of the people in this world that feels lost without a keyboard wrist rest.  I have had this same one for more years than I care to admit, and it was gross.  It was an ergonomically shaped plastic strip covered with neoprene.  Neoprene is the material that they make wetsuits out of, and it is a little scratchy on the surface.  This old wrist rest (yes, it's also a tongue twister) had signs of where my skin rested on the surface, I guess it is just dead skin cells that just kept being scratched off and piling up.  It was embarrassing to have it out whenever others came to visit my office.  So when I saw that this was antimicrobial, I had to have it.This one has a nice feel to it, it's nice and squishy in a firm way, but not solid.  Also the pleather surface has a matte texture, so your skin doesn't stick to it too terribly.  It is easily movable but stays put where you want it because the underside; the part that lays on the table surface.  It is somewhat tacky, but not adhesive.  Perfect for those who seem to be always chasing their keyboards around their desktop. It works great for my wrists, not much else to say there.  It is 19"" long, 2 3/4"" wide, and 3/4"" thick/high.And when you can remember, wipe it down with your favorite cleaning spray or wipe, and it's all good!  I have happily tossed my old wrist rest in the recycling bin and am much happier with the way my desk looks."
454,"These tabs are great for using with plastic page protectors, since once you put a piece of paper in one, regular tabs attached to paper are too short to see from the side.  Before these came along, I had to buy the Avery plastic sheet with tabs, but they are fairly pricey.You can write on these tabs with pencil, to re-use them or with ball point pen or permanent ink.  Another very handy thing about these is that since you get to pick where you stick it, it is up to you where you want to place them.The adhesive lasts a long time and I haven't had an issue with the adhesive tearing or ruining paper, when I use it on paper.  As with anything with adhesive, the less you touch it with your fingers the better.  The only thing I wish now is that they would come in more colors!"
454,"Love these labels!  I tend to keep file folders and re-use them, so I was really hopeful for this product to be good.  I have written in pencil, and tried to erase and re-use, but the file never really looks that great.  I have used stickers and tried to peel them off and put another one on top, but that never works that great either.  So with these stickers, I can actually print out something nice from the computer, and then peel it off when I feel like it.  Love it!  And I used the labels with a laser printer, and it came out great. I also used some without printing from the computer, I just wrote on it and used it. Sometimes computer printing is  too much work for a quick file label situation.Highly recommended, for all of you label-lovers out there like me."
454,"I thought this would be a good way to be able to hang papers on surfaces that I can't use a magnet on, or don't want to use tape. Yes, it works well.  The square did not leave residue on my stainless steel appliances, which is nice.  But to remove the squares from regular paper (88-92# weight) it is quite tough, and took some of the paper off with the square. The paper residue did wash off, and was fine afterward, but what about my precious artwork that my daughter drew for me?  The paper now curled back where I peeled the square off.This square adhesive tab is much sturdier than tape, so if you need something to adhere something heavier than a piece of paper to say, a wall, this might be your thing.  But for a piece of paper, I would go with some painter's tape, which won't leave a mark (it shouldn't).  I don't know how often I'll need to use these squares, so I'll just throw it into the drawer with all of the other things that I save for ""just in case""."
454,"The only problem I have with these multi-sized sticky notes is that I don't want to use them up.  That is a compliment, in my world.  I buy all kinds of sticky notes and have dozens of shapes and sizes.  This is unique because it is many different sizes in one pad. Just decide which size you need for your note or reminder, write on it, and tear it out of the pad.  If you are short on space, or maybe you want to carry it around in your bookbag or briefcase to have many sizes on hand in one little package.  It is a keeper!"
454,"If you utilize dry erase boards you will enjoy these markers.  These are fun and vibrant colors.  These markers do not show on a black dry erase board, which I did try.  You need neon markers for that.  A few of these colors are bright, but not neon.These markers erased easily, I used an old sock as an eraser.  This is a tip that my daughter was taught by her 4th grade teacher.  My kids think the barrel of these markers are too &#34;fat&#34;, but I think they are fine.  They might be a little broader in girth than a typical marker, but for your average adult it shouldn't be noticeable.In this 12 pack, you will get all of the colors listed in the description on Amazon.  You get two of the most used colors - red, blue and black.  The fun colors are:  Bright pink, lime, orange, teal, purple, green.  On the see-through barrel there is a gauge of how much ink you have left in your marker, kind of like your car gas gauge.  It has a full, 1/2 mark, and empty mark.  Love that!  I also love how the cap is not round, so it stops the marker from simply rolling off of the counter or desk.  The cap snaps easily onto the end of the cap for safekeeping while using the marker.If you are feeling bold, go for these markers.  They are a lot of fun!"
454,"Office supply freak here again at your service.  I have Post-its all over my house, in many drawers and nooks and crannies.  I also have a desk top Post-it Pop-Up dispenser, in black, weighted and all.  Very business-like.  When I saw this wall-mount Pop-Up dispenser, that utilizes the 3M Command adhesive strips for instant removal that wouldn't damage my walls, I knew I found another item I had to have!  And the colors are so much more fun.  Mine is white with a turquoise backing.  The only thing that would have been better is if it came with the pen shown in the packaging that I can buy to go with it.  It is easy enough to provide my own pen to stick in the short pen holder, so I will not complain.I installed one inside my pantry, so that I can scribble quick notes-to-self about when I refilled a cereal or nut container. I try to keep track of how long it takes my family to use up stuff, so that I can be ready to buy more when I need to.  I don't like running out of things and having to scramble for them.  I also use those notes to write quick notes to put in my kids' lunch boxes.  They do like that sort of thing!This dispenser does only work with the Pop-up pads.  They dispense vertically.  You will notice the difference in how the pads are adhered together, sort of accordion-like, and not all on one end only like a pad of paper.  They sell these wherever regular Post-its are sold, just look carefully at the packaging."
411,"I really love the bright vibrant colors that these sheets come in and the sure sticking factor I get with these Post-it labels is fantastic.I used to send away for my return address stickers,then I discovered these wonderful thingies!By going to the website listed on the pack,I get the Free templates to use in making labels that look better and importantly Stick better than my old choices.These labels look wonderful and I Love them!"
411,I love Post-Its and it's handy to have them in a on the go dispenser in my laptop case.I tried to carry the standard note pads that I keep on my desk but they always got messed up in my comp case but no longer!The slim fitting dispenser keeps the Post-Its perfect whenever I need them.SO HANDY!!!
411,"These come in great colors,hard to ignore.  Bright & Beautiful!!!The sticky factor is better on these than other brands and I prefer these to other ones.These are the BEST!"
411,"These labels are great.  Go to 3M and get a free template and in a very few minutes you'll be printing your personal custom labels.The quality of the labels themselves is the BEST,they stay stuck like they're supposed to stay and they don't get non-sticky around the edges over time before use,like some brands do....and it is sooo much fun creating your own labels successfully & it's easy!"
411,"Good Afternoon,I am addicted to stuff and when I get new stuff,I need to put the older stuff (which I still love,but slightly less than the new stuff) somewhere safe & comfortable and these well constructed boxes by Fellowes do a wonderful job.I am very familiar with the Fellowes name because I store many of my CDs & MP3 discs in jewel cases made by the Fellowes Company.In fact,the second case I filled for safe storage in my new Fellowes boxes is full of MP3 discs in Fellowes jewel cases.These boxes are safe and secure and stack nicely & easy to reopen when I realize that some of the old stuff is better than the new stuff and I want it out for use again...Fellowes Boxes are Great to hold or even move your Stuff..."
411,"All my life I've had Scotch tape near me for mending & labeling and doing tons of different things that Only Scotch tape can do!You know it and we all need and use it,it's the best quality of all the tapes out there.It's the Original and buy NO other kind of tape... It's made in the USA -  BUY AMERICAN!!!"
411,"I go through a lot of these every month and over the past few years I've noticed the stickiness seems to be getting less sticky than it used to be on some of these brands,so when I heard about the UltraHold Sticky Notes I had to check them out.I am not disappointed,these Sticky Notes have the stick-to-it-ness that I need,just like I remember how they once were,these are now.Also I like the bright color of these,much better than the faded yellow ones that just don't stick very well,that I was stuck with till now."
411,"Several times a day I have to take medical tests and log in the results for my various doctors to read and what was once a sloppy series of journal entries is now a neat and orderly group of information for my doctors,that is easy for them to peruse.The filing tabs come in 4 different colors and there are 6 of each in the package and they are sturdy enough for constant daily handling without falling apart.These great tabs help a reformed slob like myself to get neater and I'm very pleased with them,"
411,"I collect pen and pencil sets and I'm glad to add this to my collection.I've been using the Uni-Ball pen for a while now,for writing checks because it embeds the ink into the checks and makes it difficult for the ""bad people"" to rewrite the checks for their evil plans to rip me off.I like doing my check books in pencil,so now I have this cool uni-ball pencil with eraser to keep my books up to date.It's a nicely balanced feeling writing instrument that not too heavy or too light,it feels like it'll last and I like it.The set includes 2 spare erasers and a package of the new lead for the pencil that's break resistant.Pretty Cool!"
411,"When I working on some of my projects I used to just use the lame old paper markers in the several textbooks I'm dealing with but no longer...I now use these great Avery NoteTabs that don't defeat the purpose of the markers by falling out and they're clear so they don't obscure the text.When I'm done with the projects I can remove them Without damaging my valuable booksThese Avery NoteTabs are a great asset,I wish I'd gotten them sooner."
411,"Thanks to this neat & clean source of adhesive,I'm done with glue and the lousy double sided tape,HOORAY!I do folders,photographs and scrapbooks of some of my favorite things and now they won't be the worse for wear as with my old sloppy glue technique, instead these neat and clean adhesive dots...Brilliant!Easy and clean,great stuff!"
411,"There are many jobs around the house that require the holding power of Super Glue but the dispenser that it used to come in,left a lot to be desired.I think I must have thrown out most of the tubes I'd opened in the past,before I'd used the majority of the contents because of the clumsy container,but things have really changed in a good way.Because of the Precision Applicator,I easily dispensed the correct amount of glue and re-sealed the package in a way that I'll be able to use again,whenever I need it.I'm thankful for this great new dispenser and the same great glue"
411,"These Scotch mounting tabs are incredible!Around my office space I have a bunch of action figures for several of my favorite movies and historical people (They are NOT dolls Dag-nab-it!!!) and because I live in earthquake country they tend to fall over all the time but NO LONGER!!!  Now they are secure on the surface because of these wonderful tabs and I couldn't be more pleased with these reusable tabs.The Dude Abides and doesn't fall over.Several years ago I got an incredible European Iggy Pop tour poster and because it's so rare I didn't want to poke holes in it to get it on the wall but now it's perfectly on my wall minus any holes and it's up there so securely,these things are GREAT!So many wonderful uses and priced so greatYIPPEE!!!!"
411,"For years I sent away for the ""professional"" return address stickers,even though I've had a computers and printers since the last century...but NO LONGER!!!!It's so easy printing my own and they look so great.You just go to the 3M website listed on the package and download the FREE templates and in a few minutes you have these address stickers and they look Great!I wish I'd discovered this years ago"
411,Many years ago I used many 3 ring notebooks and with the advent of Filofax and other trendy notebooks I'd quit using the old stand by and I recently noticed that I have a pile of packs of the paper for the old notebooks and wondered what to do with several thousand sheets of the the wide ruled paper... then I saw the Avery EZ-Turn ring!This well put together binder holds 500 sheets of paper (a full pack!)and it's smooth turning of the pages so I can go easily to different sections of all these pages that I've divided up into different categories.The inside of the binder has 4 pockets (2 front/2 back) for putting papers you want close at hand and the entire outside (front/binder/back)has clear plastic on top of the white cover so you can label and personalize the binder and make it your own. The inside binder area has room to put a couple pens or pencils.This is truly a 21st century update of an old favorite at a GREAT price!
411,"I'm always using Post-It's but the pads always get knocked off the desk and go missing...BUT NO LONGER!!!These beauties come two to the pack and my life now has the order I'd hoped for all these years.Each dispenser comes with 4 easy to use Velcro strips so you can position them perfectly where you need them and they will no longer disappear because of a careless bump.With room for a pen or pencil,these dispensers help eliminate some of the desk clutter and I'm really pleased with them.Nice colors too,like I said NEATO!"
698,"I picked this product to review because I recently purchased a 2010 planner that does not have dividers for each month.  I thought these might come in handy, so that I can use these to divide my planner by the months.I like the roundness of the label--easier to spot in my planner, but you would need to write really small for these to work, unless you didn't need to write on the colored part of the label, which I do.  I also think I would prefer a brighter color, to make them stand out.  These are pastel colors.  The colored part of the label is just alittle too small for me.These do seem very durable, where the more transparent part of the label is, and more room to write there too.It might be fun to think of all the useful ways a person can use these.  They are a definite improvement over regular dividers!"
698,"This is the perfect little item, especially during the holiday gift giving season.  There is more than enough tape in this package of 2 wrist band tape dispensers, and 2 desktop tape dispensers.  Then there are 6 other tape refills included.The tape is already loaded into the desktop tape dispensers, but you will need to put it into the wrist tape dispensers.  I found refilling both items to be alittle tricky.The length of the tape strips is perfect, not too small or too long, so no tape is wasted.The wrist band dispenser will free up your hands for wrapping gifts, but I keep one in my kitchen too, in my gadget drawer.  I always seem to be needing tape for one thing or another.I have never used the desktop dispensers before, so I decided to put one of them next to my keyboard, on my desk.The desktop dispensers each use 2 refills, while the wristband dispenser uses only one refill.I like the configuration of this package.  On less thing to remember to purchase.  This package will give you enough tape for most of your taping needs.Tape to me is like batteries.  Something you always want to have on hand, because you will need it.  Especially around the holidays."
698,"Iam the kind of person who is always doing more than one thing at once.  If I have my tv on, Iam generally at my computer working.  If Iam watching tv, Iam also looking at my daily planner, writing, looking at the week ahead.  I can just keep a dispenser with these post it notes by my chair, to jot down last minute thoughts, grocery lists, what have you.I keep notepads and post it notes by most of my house phones.  These post it notes would work to use by your phone, but also when you are out and about.  The slim size of the pad and holder make them so you could even put them in your shirt pocket.I always keep a pad and pen in my purse.  You could just put one of these in your purse with a pen.  It's nice that it comes in a set of 3, with 3 different colored dispensers, which look like coated paper.  All the pads are a light yellow color.  There is an adhesive strip on the back, if you wanted to affix them to something, like your laptop.  The dispenser is also refillable.Very versatile!"
698,"I picked these dividers to review, because I recently purchased a 2010 planner that does not have dividers for the months.  I thought these would be helpful, so that I can divide my planner by the month myself.Blue and pink are my favorite colors.  I like the more neon colors of these labels, easier to see in my planner since they are bright.You will need to write small where the colored part of the divider is.  I wish they were just a bit larger in that area.  The more transparent part below the colored part is much larger, and seems very durable.  Much more room to write there, if you need to.  A definite improvement over regular dividers!I like that these come in a pack of 40.  I hope to find other uses for these dividers.  Another problem solved, at least for me!"
698,"I think Scotch tape has been around as long as I can remember.  This tape came with 3 rolls of tape, each 3/4"" X 300"".  When you look at each roll tho, it doesn't look like there is much tape on each roll.  I would have preferred one large roll of tape, instead of these 3 separate rolls of tape.Better for the environment too, to only package one large roll, instead of these 3 smaller rolls, unless you really need more than one roll of tape at a time, maybe in different rooms.This tape is practically invisible when applied, and you can write on it with a pen, pencil or marker.All in all, a very good tape to have on hand."
698,"I had just purchased these same filing tabs at Walmart.  Normally I like Post-It products, but these filing tabs I did not like as much as the same sized Avery filing tabs that I already have.First of all, the colored part at the top of the tab is like a very thin line, and not that bright in color, then the rest of the tab part is white, where you would write on, so if you are trying to use these filing tabs, and hoping that the tabs will stand out by color, the top of the filing tab, then these aren't the best filing tabs to use.Secondly, the opaque part of the filing tab is is not as thick as Avery's filing tabs.  The part where the colored part of the tab is, they are too straight on the Post-Its filing tabs, just slightly rounded on the sides, just like the whole Post-It filing tab,there is no difference in shape on the Post-Its filing tab, the part where you would write on, and the opaque part, tho the part that you would write on is slightly larger across the Post-Its filing tab, while Avery's are more pronounced on the sides of the filing tabs, where you would write on, the colored part of the tab, then just square in shape the opaque part, and just a little bit smaller, plus the colored part on the Avery filing tab is much brighter than this filing tab from Post-It.Yes, both tabs are reusable as far as the opaque part is concerned, but unless you are going to use the same part that you wrote on, the filing tab, with the same words that you wrote on that for another project, then neither filing tabs will work for that.  Unless the part  you wrote on it with pencil or another writing instrument that will be erasable.  Then the whole filing tab could be reused.I use filing tabs for yearly planners that have no dividers as far as the months are concerned, so that I put the filing tabs on the sides of the months where the 2 pages are for each month at a glance, so that I can see where the next months 2 pages are, then I mark them with another filing tab.In summary, I think fiing tabs are a great thing to have on hand for many different uses, but for me personally I prefer filing tabs where the part that you would write on is brighter in color, and that the colored part of the filing tab covers a larger area of the the tab before you get to the opaque part of the tab, and that the entire filing tab is not the same shape, like the Post-It filing tab is, both on the part that you would write on and the opaque part.They also make filing tabs that are more like a half moon shape at the top of the tab, the colored part of the tab.Juat decide what kind of tab you will need for the project that you need a filing tab for, if you need a brighter color for the part you would write on or not, look at your various choices then go on for there.These Post It filing tabs are ok, they just don't work as well for me, for what I need them for.  Maybe they will work for you.Also, the part that you would write on, as I said, the colored part of the Post It filing tab, it's only at the very top of the tab is the color part, a thin line, then the rest of the tab part is just plain white, til it gets to the opaque part of the filing tab.On the Avery filing tab, the colored part of the tab, the colored part is all the way down, til you get to the opaque part of the filing tab.I guess it's a personal preference, but I prefer the Avery filing tab much more for my uses.It's not that the Post It filing tab is bad, it's just not as pronounced as I would like it to be."
698,"Up to this point, I've been using glue sticks for scrapbooking, but this Scotch Adhesive Dot Roller is less messy to use than glue sticks.  It goes on smoothly, evenly.I did have alittle bit of a problem trying to get it to work the first time, but maybe that was just me."
698,"Here you have a 5 pack of sticky notes, in 5 different vibrant neon colors.  They are all in one pad, in graduated sizes, each pad is about 1/2"" larger than the one before it, so depending on what you are writing, you can decide on what sized piece of sticky notes you need, without having to have each pad separately, it's all on the same pad, but each sized note is in a different color, from a neon orange, which is the smallest sized sticky note, at 3"" X 2.5"", to the largest sticky note, which is a neon pink, and it's 3"" X 4.5"".The yellow sticky note is 3"" X 3"", the neon green sticky note is 3"" X 3.5"", the neon blue sticky note is 3"" X 4"".This is a good idea for someone who really uses sticky notes, in different sizes, but wants sticky notes in a more compact size, having them all at your fingertips."
698,"I really didn't see that much difference in these envelopes versus the peel and seal envelopes.Both have the blue inside, but instead of having to pull the strip off where you seal the envelope, this kind of envelope you just raise that part, and then put the flap over that, make sure it's closed and that's it.The weight of the envelope isn't any heavier than regular envelopes.I do like that you don't have to lick the envelopes closed, but you don't have to do that with the peel and seal envelopes either, much in the same way you don't need to lick stamps anymore to adhere them.I did notice that this kind of envelope it is alittle harder to open, so I guess maybe that is a good thing?I always put a piece of scotch tape over the flap of the envelope, to make it harder for would be thieves to get into the envelope, but I also add sealing labels, so I do that to protect them too, as well as my mailing label, in case the envelope gets wet.I have had mail theft more than once.  Money taken out of an envelope that was meant as a gift to me, which I never received.  Have documented that with my postmaster general.This isn't a bad envelope, just ok, at least to me.  I would like to see an envelope that is alittle heavier than this, in the same size.  I have always liked the blue lining, which this envelope also has, so that it's harder to identify the contents of the envelope."
698,"I've used Post It Notes for years.  I always keep a pad by my computer.  What I like about this product is, first of all it came in a set of 2, in my 2 favorite colors of hot pink and hot blue, the color of the notes, as well as the base and back of the dispenser.Secondly, the dispenser is thin so it doesn't take up any room, so I just have it on my desk, but you also have the option of mounting it on a wall if you so choose.  It comes with Command Strips if you choose to mount it.The dispenser also has a place for a pen which is nice. It has a sleek modern look to it.I also like that it comes with post it notes included.A good organizational tool.  Who doesn't need a pen and paper on their desk, whether at home or at work?"
698,"My dispenser came in a hot pink color, one of my favorite colors.  I had some problems opening the dispenser, so that I could put the tape strips inside.  There are directions tho, but mine just seems stuck, but I finally was able to open it.  Putting the tape strips inside was easy.I mainly wanted to try this because when wrapping gifts I always have a problem making the ends of the paper neat and smooth.  Having your hands free so that you can make the paper smooth and neat helps when you aren't having to hold the tape dispenser in one hand, and pulling the tape with the other.I also think the tape strips size are the perfect length.  I use alot of scotch tape, so this will come in handy, but I will mainly use it for gift wrap as it is much more costly to use these tape strips than a roll of tape.  I mostly use gift bags, which are easier and faster in the long run.The band fit nicely on my wrist.  This did make my gift wrapping more fun, and less of a chore. I was able to wrap my gifts much faster too.  Amazing what you can do when your hands are free!"
698,"Iam always looking for ways to reuse things in my house, including office supplies.These heavyweight, letter sized manila folders are stronger and thicker, so that I can reuse them more than once, which is what I would like to do.  The writing tab is a lot larger, should you need that.With the Post It labels that I already have, which they are easily removable, and the bright green color makes it easy to see the files and what is on them, I feel Iam all set.The heavyweight letter sized folders comes in a box of 50, which is plenty for me, since I only have a home office.The only thing I wish were different about these heavyweight folders is I wish them came in various colors, not the standard one color they come in.  Having them in colors wouldn't make them better necessarily, but would make using them more enjoyable.  Since I also use the Pendaflex dividers I guess it really doesn't make that much difference in whether they are colored folders or not."
698,"I love that this Sticky Notes Cube is 400 sheets, and that it's not all one color, but bright shades of blue, pink, yellow and green.  The way they designed the colors in layers is visually appealing too, with equal parts of the bright blue at the top and bottom of the cube, then a smaller layer of the bright pink, followed by the same amount of yellow, a larger layer of the bright green, and so on, alternating layers of colors.The fact that this cube is 400 sheets, it should last for some time too, before needing another note cube.I think this would be great to have on a desk or by the phone, to jot down anything you might need to remember.This isn't the Pop Up Notes, which I prefer over this kind of cube, but I did start out years ago with just a one color Post It Pad.  At least this is more visually interesting.The size of this cube is 3"" X 3"", so not too small to write on."
1113,"I wish these are more reusable but I guess I can't ask for too much.It's sticky but if you carry around your binder or notebook too much when you go from place to place, it might lose its grip.I do like that it's big enough to write real words on them. I write largely and I've always disliked the small tabs."
1113,"It feels thin and cheap. Using it over existing text does not cover the existing text. You can still see the text underneath. Otherwise, nothing special."
1113,"I'm cheap, so I think something like this that costs more than $5 is a bit much, though I must admit that this will last you quite a while if you use pencils to write on them because you can use them over and over.I don't like keeping one notebook for each of my classes, and I use LiveScribe pen paper that came in notebooks. Instead, I put all of my classes in one binder with separators, and rather than using whole page separations, I've began using these. They're large enough to see easily where the sections are divided, and easy to use for turning. One trick personally for me is to stick it on the underside of the sheet instead of the top side.Nice product. I do wish they came in more colors in the same pack, though."
1113,"When I first clicked to order, I didn't realize it were made of paper rather than cloth.The package came with two of these boxes, flattened. The black plastic handles were in a separate bag. The box was easy to put together - just popped everything in and it's shaped up, and the handles were easily popped on. Originally, I had hoped to put it into my IKEA  bookshelf cubes, but these boxes turned out way too small for them, and looks funny when I'd put them in. They don't look BAD, however. I enjoy seeing them with the dark espresso shelves. From a distance they look almost like fabric material boxes. They look quite contemporary to me. My husband hates them, though - he thinks they look cheap.Overall, I think these are good boxes. They should hold books fine. I do wish the bottom come with a softer material so that if heavier things were put in them, they won't scratch up furniture when I use them as storage drawers."
1113,"I have a simple laser mouse, therefore, I don't use a mouse pad. I had thought perhaps this would be great on my desk, which is very dark chocolate brown.It looks great on the desk, and with my computers. However, it's a bit hard, and I actually feel more comfortable without it. If it would be more supportive and supple, I would have given it a better rating. The bottom side of my arm and wrist start to hurt after half an hour or so.Its non-slip bottom also isn't very effective because once dust gets on it, it no longer grabs the desk as easily. I have a wooden desk.However, it's built well, a hefty piece of wrist wrest and looks great on my dark desk with my black keyboard and black laptop."
1113,"I've used a variety of other similar tabs and this one is much like the others - very comparable. It is quite large. I used these on textbooks rather than casual reading novels as book marks of interesting places. They are sturdy and easy to remove/move around. I share some of these with my boyfriend so that he could use them for his studies as well, and he has really loved them, too. They do not leave residues on pages when removed, and they stay on securely and do not bend easily when the books sit inside his crowded backpack."
1113,"I had no idea what I was requesting when I ordered this. I simply thought it looked interesting.Wow, what a great product.Firstly, the size. It's the perfect size for office storage, and for anyone's hand. It's not too big for me, and I have a pretty small hand. I think even a more brute person would not mind using this.Basically, it's a double sided tape. It is so easy to use. You press it down and you roll - then simply lift when you're done. No cutting, and it's straight. The glue is so thin, there is practically no dimension to it. It sticks very well. However, I am not sure why it's dotted. I guess it's easier to cut off when you lift?However, it's not really heavy-duty, so if you have very heavy paper or something that gets moved around a lot, it may not stay for long.This is so wonderful for projects. I am wondering whether or not they have an alternate version with round, thick glue dots instead of these little dots, so I could use it to make a wedding guest tree for my upcoming wedding."
1113,"Don't write it on the clear part, it won't stay.Overall, I like the width of this product because I can write more than just a couple of letters on it. It's sturdy against the paper. However, like most stick and remove products, after using it on different surfaces a few times it stops being as sticky and leaves a little residule. However, it's nothing I would actually complain about! Plus, if you do not remove them constantly, it's actually very durable. Just try to make sure that the surfaces you use it with are pretty clean. I really really love how it is see-through and it does not seem to ""pick up"" any ink or highlighter colors on the tab either.I also like the three colored tabs. It helps me organize my sections quite well. Again, try not to transfer these too many times, otherwise it's not as useful anymore.I recommend this for a long thesis/paper that you'll turn in and never use again. It makes your paper look nice."
1113,"This is very comparable to its 3M competition. The stickiness is average - you can still peel it off if you want. The problem is, it's just as thin as the 3M competitor and anything you put over you can still see through the white sticker. I use it to cover over old file folder tags but it doesn't work super well."
1113,"When I used it initially in my classroom wall, which is painted flat, they worked well in holding small posters (approximately 20 inches x 15 inches), but when I tried hanging larger, odd sized posters, such as a full size poster, the posters themselves would fall off of the wall while the tabs are still on the wall.Worst, when I tried removing the tabs from the wall, they took the paint off of the walls, too, leaving an ugly white patch.Unless you're hanging very small things that may not require moving to another location, I would not recommend these tabs."
1113,"These are so beautiful to look at, and the built-in tabs makes the files look so much more organized. I like the thick, durable feeling of each folder, and love that it comes in different colors in a box.The pastel colors allow me to easily read what is said when I use a marker, but it's not boring and white. The material of the paper is soft, but sturdy. These can definitely last a very long time in my office just like the other hanging folders I already have - the ""green"" material doesn't make them any weaker. However, they do sag and expand a little like the other ones.On the downside, which is inevitable for this product - the tabs, unless you use an erasable writing utensil, cannot be changed when you change the designation of the folder. You'll probably want to use a mailing or address label to cover it up in the future to rename them. I do love the rounded edges of the tabs.Overall, if your purpose is to never have to change the tab names, then these are PERFECT. They look great, feel great, and will last a very long time and functions comparably as the not-so-fancy ones."
1113,"The photo makes it look slim and more portable. Actual product is a lot more bulky. But it is just a pen, so I'm not too picky about it.It says it has ""smear guard"" but depending on what kind of paper you're using this on, I would still wait a few seconds before touching it. It does smear on my semi-glossy textbook pages, if I try touching it immediately after I use it. So, use common sense. That said, the markings did dry VERY QUICKLY, and even though it was not 100% smear proof, a light ""dab"" of the finger would not have created disaster on your page.It glides very easily across the page, very smooth. I liked it a lot. However, again, the types of paper will effect it. Overall, it's a great product!So long as you don't press down too hard, it doesn't seem to bleed through the pages very much.Now, the picture shown on my computer shows much brighter colors. The actual product I received seemed to have much darker colors, almost marker-like. FYI."
1113,"... but it sure works pretty well.I was very surprised at how nicely it worked dry. I thought, hey, just a piece of sponge - how special can it be?My board has had a lot of use - especially with markers that weren't meant to be used on a white board. However, with just a little soaking, this thing worked wonders, and kept the board pretty dry. I didn't have to use another paper towel to wipe off the liquid.However, it does get pretty nasty after use. It needs to be very thoroughly cleaned, otherwise, just touching it will make your hand dirty.Okay, I have an update now after a month's use:Once you've used water to clean (which worked wonders), the board becomes more difficult to erase. This happens also when I use a white board cleaner, so it might be due to my board. Also, once you've used it with water, even after the eraser has dried, it's not nearly as easy to use anymore. It gets the board dirty with the residue dusts."
775,"I have 5 November birthdays and each of them got a few presents.  This Scotch tape is perfect.  It tears off nicely and when you put it on your packages, you can't even notice it's there.  Scotch is the only brand I ever got but they improved the quality of this tape by making it invisible.Also, the price on Amazon is great.  I highly recommend it if you are fussy with your packages like I am."
775,"just when you thought that tape dispensers were all the same, this comes along.you might think this is gimmicky but it's not.  it is actually very useful.there is a rubber grip thing on the bottom and it does stay in place when you pull out the tape.when you get this, you have to load the tape.  i had a little problem with this but that is because i hate reading directions.once i got the tape in it, it was great.  i have it right by my keyboard, where i always need tape for one thing or another.one day, i was on the phone, and typing on the computer and i need tape because i just ripped a phone number in half, i reached over and grabbed a piece of this and within seconds, i had the paper repaired.i didn't have to go hunting for the tape, and didn't need another hand to hold the dispenser.this is worth the money.i am not sure how much the replacements tapes are and depending on that, i would buy one of these.if you multi-task like me and never have 2 free hands, this is for you"
775,"I have 2 offices, one at home and one at work and I am always looking for ways to keep it simple.i did get file folders from vine before and they were wonderful.  Now, I decided to organzie my drawers and boxes and other things in both offices.What i really like about these is the amount of sticky.  They really do hold.  The fact that they are color coded made it easier to place things in order and to retrieve them later.  Regular ball point pens also write well on them too.  There is no smearing or pen skipping.If you want to remove your labels, you can without damaging what they stuck to and it doesn't leave behind a sticky mess.I really like these and if I ever reorganize again, I will certainly pick up a new pack of them."
775,"First let me say, I already used up the whole pack and have gone out and bought my second pack of these labels.  I have two home offices and I also work outside.  I redid my 7 filing cabinets with these.  The bright colors makes a difference.  The stickiness is perfect.  YOu know how you pull files out of the drawer, and then you mess up the labels...well, with these, they stay perfectly in place.  I have about 5 left over after redoing my cabinets and I used them to index my Christmas shopping book.  I have a notepad with everyones name and the presents I bought them so far ( I start shopping in March or April, so I need a list).  I color coded the pages by immediate family, family, friends, co workers and other.  ""Other"" being little gifts for neighbors and such.  It was a blessing and a huge help.  I had to run out and find these and buy another pack.  I can't say enough about the stickiness factor.  It could probably go through a wind storm and they would still stick.  These things are good for alot more.  If you flip through magazines, it's good to mark pages you want to buy things on, my mother used some for her adress/phone book, my fiance used some for his fantasy football book (not the pink ones) and I gave my cousin a few and she used them to mark pages in her bible !  I am telling you, this is a great product with many, many uses.  The next time you are on Amazon, please order a pack.  You will find a thousand uses for them !  I might add, when you remove these labels, there is  NO residue.  As sticky as they are, they come off clean.  It's really incredible.  I removed some from pages in a book and they just came off, no sticky, no ripping, no crinkling the pages.  Great product"
775,"I bought a laminator about 4 months ago and I wanted to laminate my recipes. It was so hard to figure out.  I had to put it together and then when I finally got it going, it didn't heat up enough to stick the sheets together.  I was thrilled to get this one.It's very , very easy to work. Basically, jsut plug it in.  I did all my recipes and they came out perfect.  It was a nice tight seal and I need that because when I bake and cook, I always get them dirty and have to rinse them off.This came with a pack of 100 sheets too. The warm up is only 5 minutes.If you're looking for a lamintor and are a little afraid of them, get this machine.It's very simple and I'm not technical at all and hate reading instructions.It's a great little machine for all kinds of uses.My mom and hubby want to use it for other things and if my mom can use it, anyone can.great machine !"
775,"i have 3 offices and use many office products.  i love post it products.  they stick well and come off easy.  i use these for my day planner and also i have a book of birthdays, anniversaries etc and i have each month tabbed and labeled so i can just flip right to the month.  it's so much easier.  you wouldn't think a little product like this would be helpful but i guarentee if you get these, you will find hundreds of uses for them."
775,I love these tabs.  I use them for looking in catalogs and marking pages.  I put the quantity and size of things I want to order.  I used them at work. I have to do alot of reading contracts and I marked pages that needed clarification.  They are see through and sticky.  They come off the page easy and do not rip paper.  I think this is a great idea and I will go and buy more of these.
775,"This couldn't have come at a better time.  I ripped the wall paper in my kitchen. It had a rip about 4 inches wide, 5 inches long and it was hanging off.  I tried the ""white"" glue but it made it bumpy.  As soon as I got this, I tried it.  It's perfect.  The precision applicator makes it so you can add a little tiny point of glue anywhere.  This stuff is strong.  It can hold anything.I have tons of other projects just waiting to be done now.I will even get another bottle when this one runs out.Perfect !"
775,"At first I didn't think I would like these or even know what the difference would be but how wrong I was.I love the ""steps"".  you really don't know how much you use them unless you get a pack of these and give them a try.First let me say the quality of the paper is great, and pens write smooth and the sticky part is really sticky.I write notes all the time for my job so I am always looking for a new way, easier way to write my notes, retrieve my notes and keep them.  The steps are really a great idea.  If you write on the first few notes, and then want to get a note under them, you have no trouble locating the note.  It is not a necessity but it does make work a little easier and more interesting."
775,"if you need an envelope to send things in, this is the perfect one.The best thing i liked about this is the Reveal-a-Seal.  No more licking !!!it's sooooo easy.  No more papercuts on your tongue (yes, i did get them), no more awful taste in your mouth and no more worrying if the envelope is sealed.  this is perfect.  i have one bill each month that i pay and they don't give me envelopes.  six months ago the company contacted me and told me i was late in payment. i had the cancelled check that said i paid on time. i put a trace on it and it turned out my envelope seal did not hold and the contents opened up in the mailbox and spilled out.  the post office was holding my check.this will NEVER happen with these envelopes.  i sealed one and immediately opened it up and the seal was so strong, even after a second of being sealed.theya re a great weight too.  you can see through themthey make my life a whole lot easier and i wish i would have had them 6 mos. ago, it would have saved me time, trouble and a delinquent notice on my credit report.when my samples run out, i will order more from amazon.  they are worth it."
775,"I have two offices and use post it notes all over the place.  I usually misplace the pack and have to go hunting for them.This is the solution.  This actually sticks to soemthing. I stuck it to my wall on a cork board and it is wonderful.  It's within arms reach and I never have to go searching for a note again. It pops up fine.I did have a little trouble putting it together but that could be do to the fact that I really dont' read directions and just open things and try to assemble.The stickiness is just right and the thing I really like about this is when you pull one out, the other one under it sticks out so you can grab it very easily.I am thinking of getting a few more of these, one for by my phone so I never hear the excuse they coudln't find a piece of paper to write a message on:) and one for my car.  There are lots of times I am in my car and I hear something adverstised and want to remember it.  I think this would be a great solution.  There is also a place for a pen too.Great, innovative product !"
775,"I had to say, this product is almost perfect.It is very convienent to use when both hands are wrapping a gift or doing project.However one of the drawbacks is that if you pull a little too hard, the tape packet comes out or the little piece on top opens up.  You really have to pull in a certain direction and pull gingerly.If it wasn't for that, this would get a perfect rating.I am a little rough with products, so it doesn't surprise me that it came apart twice while I was wrapping.I was in a hurry and just don't have the time to be playing around and wrapping gifts !It's a great idea.If SCOTCH wants an improvement idea, make the top piece a little more secure and sturdier.  Also, a little larger tape packet would make it worth the money."
775,"love these colors, the stickiness of them and the writing surface.I am a big fan of ""sticky"" notes and these are great.I use them all day long at work and also for my own use, shopping lists, to-do lists etc so I have used all different kinds.These are probably the top of the ones I tried.  I love the colors !"
1871,"Papers, files, notebooks,textbooks, bills, folders, you name it, we have it in our desks at work, school and at home.  Enter these nifty little see-through note tabs by AVERY and your search for the right page is over!  This pack of 40 tabs, each measuring a generous 2"" x 1 1/2"", will make organizing papers a snap.  Write on the tab or highlight text beneath it and you'll be able to see through it; place it anywhere on your page, even reposition without causing rips, peels.  In most cases, it won't cause ink lifts either.  They are both easy to see in bright neon colors, and very durable, withstanding repeated turns.  Other flimsy tabs don't measure up to the quality of these AVERY labels; I highly recommend them for all your organizational projects."
1871,"I use binders for all my household paperwork, and so do my kids.  We are always stuck with rings that become loose and create gaps once we fill the binders, so this product was extra appealing due to the fact that it claims to have heavy duty rings and durable hinges.  We agree!  The rings are literally gap free, they stay tight even with the one finger press to easily open them.  The front and back clear view storage cover makes it perfect for creating eye catching covers to easily identify contents.  There are also convenient double pocket storage slip in pockets inside the front and back covers.  These are especially useful with you have business cards to store with the contents of the binder, or just to throw a little sticky pad in for quick notes.  This 1&#34; size if good for school, work or home.  I have the 2&#34; for heavier storage needs, i.e. banking and household medical records.  Terrific quality at an affordable price."
1871,"Though they are traditionally for business use, we were happy to have these letter size bankers boxes for our family document storage this year.  The annual year end process of clean out and storage of files, important receipts, statements, etc., can be tedious and unorganized if you don't have the right organizational tools.  These bankers boxes worked well for us.  We were able to store expandable letter folders as well as binders and single file folders neatly in the boxes.  Very easily assembled, the boxes are triple reinforced so they stand up to heavy loads.  The handles are especially well made as they include a two piece clip together cut out that enables you to carry the box without tearing the opening.  The clear front side window make it easy to spot what's inside, or even have an index sheet showing through so you don't have to rifle through the contents when you need to put your hands on something quickly.  The stack well atop one another and can be easily stored in your closet, office, attic or garage.  The black and white scroll design is very pleasant compared to most other storage items.  A great product and a good deal."
1871,"These were to be used in our classrooms for the teachers to leave notes and pointers on students' essays.  We found that the regular sticky notes got misplaced or flew off in transit between the desk, the folders, and home.  So these seemed like a great new tool.  They stick on great, but this added feature is precisely what makes them bad for sheets of paper. Reason?  They stick so well, that when you attempt to peel them off, the paper beneath them comes off with the sticky!  Not only were the essay pages ripped, but in one case the actual sticky ripped off, leaving the adhesive side stuck to the student's work.  The idea is great, but the product is not suited for use on regular paper, maybe just for thicker stock like folders or binders."
1871,"This handy little tape machine by SCOTCH makes packing a snap.  Rubbery comfort handle allows for prolonged handling without hand cramping.  The see-through blue top lets you see how much tape you have left.  Easy-open cover pops open once you depress both sides of the button release latches, and then just slide a replacement roll of packing tape when it's time to refill.  No cumbersome threading around dangerous blades.  Smooth rolling too.  The whole unit is light as a feather and fits neatly in a desk drawer or shelf.  Great for home or office."
1871,"No better way to get your piles of paperwork into organized shape than to use Post-It tabs.  These are extra strong and made for the purpose of heavy handling and use.  We put a half year's worth of student papers in order in our home with these things.  Using a different color for each subject, these tabs are easy to write on, will stick to any paper surface, and if you carefully peel them off, they won't tear your sheets.  I will be stocking up on these come year-end to put the kids' school work in order for the whole school year.  Love the bright neon shades of yellow, orange, green and pink too!"
1871,"Having first used the smaller tabs, I was used to just flagging pages with little to no written notes due to the lack of space on the tab.  These new generously sized 3"" x 3 1/2"" inch note tabs are like sticky pads only 100 times more durable.  You simple peel and stick anywhere from textbook pages, photo albums, magazines, even phone books or filing drawers, and you have space to write notes on top of the see-through square.  My kids love them for saving their pages in books, or for marking their homework pages in their workbooks.  The package comes 20 per pack, I only wish they sold them in larger quantities since they seem to be disappearing faster than I can restock my desk drawers."
1871,"I have shelves of plastic binders and portfolio-type folders which must be updated every four months.  These removable file folder labels make the tedious quarterly project a snap.  All I do is peel off the old and replace wth a new, no scraping residue off binders, or taping over old labels.  The size is generous enough to say what you need to say, and the crisp white makes for an easy glance to find what you need quickly.I plan to organize folders in my hanging cabinets this way too, plus use it for the kids' school papers.  This is a great addition to my home office and I recommend the product highly."
1871,"I'm glad I found these handy AVERY labels, they have more uses around the office, school and house than we could imagine.  This pack of 20 tabs, each measuring a generous 2"" x 1 1/2"", have rounded ends and will make organizing papers a snap whether it's a textbook, a folder of papers, recipe cards, magazine, you name it.  Write on the tab or highlight text beneath it and you'll be able to see through it; place it anywhere on your page, even reposition without causing rips or peels.  In most cases, it won't cause ink lifts either.  These come in a citrus green and yellow, are very durable, and withstand repeated turns.  Other flimsy tabs don't measure up to the quality of these AVERY labels; I highly recommend them for all your organizational projects.  We created separate file boxes for each child with the important papers from the school year, doctor visits, Sunday School, etc., and these tabs make it a cinch to quickly find the section we need whenever we have to refer to something in particular.  Personally I prefer the squared edged note tabs over these rounded ends, but both sets will be useful and between me and the kids, they'll disappear in no time."
1871,"I like that these are convenient to place around the house, i.e., kitchen, office, beside the phone, etc.  I don't use mine for my laptop, however, this is how they're supposed to be used.  I don't like that I will have to fork over extra money for refill pads which specifically are needed for dispensers as these cost a few dollars more, but if I use them sparingly, they'll be worth the occasional investment.  This three pack has plain yellow post-it notes and the cardboard-like dispensers, in various pretty colors, have a sticky back for placement wherever you need them.  The warning label cautions that the sticky might damage certain surfaces, but so far I haven't had a problem.  I would recommend these for light duty needs in areas where you don't need more than an occasional piece of scrap paper."
1871,"Avery is my first choice in office supplies like binders and labels because they make quality products at affordable prices.  This white 2 inch binder has EZ-turn rings which makes loading and unloading your papers a breeze.  The left inside cover features duo plastic storage pockets, one on the bottom and one midway up.  This extra feature came in handy.The front and back covers are really durable and solid, making for strong storage capabilities and ease of placement in shelves.  My favorite home use for these is during the school year where I purchase one for each child and create their year long binder of work that we like to keep year to year.  I also made a ""Manual"" binder which holds all the instruction booklet for the various appliances around the house.  I give this product my highest rating."
1871,"These are small enough not to bulk up your books, yet large enough to jot a quick little note.  Great for notebooks, novels, file folders, etc.  They make finding what you need a snap whether at school, work or home.  I like to mark off certain things in the family's medical record files over the years, i.e., dental work, blood tests, etc. and these make it easy to find what we need in each family member's records without having to sort through loads of papers.  Teachers in our school encourage the students to flag important passages in their chapters when preparing for a big test.  They stick on well, remove easily without marring the paper, and come in bright, easy to spot, cheerful colors.  Another great little product by Avery."
1430,"These tags come in handy for organizing my craft supplies and patterns.  Obviously, they can be used for all sorts of organizing.  The colors are nice, cool blues and modern greens.  They add color while being useful.  I'd recommend."
1430,"I have found this item to be useful, especially in my craft room.  I like using it when a little bit of adhesive is needed and when I don't want to get out glue and make a mess.  The adhesive dots are easy to apply and hold very well.  I can think of a zillion uses for this.  It will definitely get a lot of use in my home.  I particularly like the fact that I can buy refills for it without buying the dispenser again.  I won't go on and on, but I'd highly recommend this product.  It works wonders for me."
1430,"These little tabs are great for mounting lightweight things on walls or wherever else you'd like to hang things without making messy holes, etc.  They're great for kids' posters, art, and more.  I'd definitely buy them again, they are really coming in handy for all kinds of things."
1430,"I've used these labels for just about everything.  Labeling boxes, organizing, etc.  They are great for printing multiple address labels at home with your computer.  I particularly like making my own return address labels with cute art without having to have 5 million of the same design.  Good quality, dependable labels, I'd recommend."
1430,"These tags are very handy for labeling folders, etc.  I use them to organize craft supplies.  A basic item that does the job."
1430,"I can never have enough Post It Notes around.  I really like these (they're Avery notes, not Post-It brand but they are basically the same).  What makes these different is that they come in a pad with all different sizes and colors in one pad.  You don't have to rip off the top sheet like you usually do, you can choose a different size from a different part of the pad while keeping the pad intact.  There are five sizes to choose from, the first being a regular sized Post-It size, then there are four more levels, each about a half inch larger than the last size. Each size is a different color (orange, yellow, green, blue and pink).  I use a lot of these notes for all kinds of things.  I'd recommend and I'll definitely buy again."
1430,"I'd recommend these erasers for whiteboards.  They do the job perfectly, no mess.  Easy to clean.  They can also be used to erase permanent marker, but I haven't used them for that purpose, just for erasing my white board.  Not much more to say, nice product."
1430,"I think other people would get more practical use out of these than I do, but I am happy to have them on hand for extra tape when I'm in a pinch.  After using the dispensers that attach to your hand, I do prefer my old weighted down tape dispenser for wrapping gifts, etc.  Personally, I feel it's just as easy to grab a piece of tape from my heavy dispenser than to attach this to my hand.  But if you don't use a heavy tape dispenser, and you actually have to pick up those light, plastic tape dispensers to tear off pieces while holding down wrapping paper with your elbow because you don't have any little elves to assist you in wrapping, then this product will definitely benefit you.  It would be much easier to not have to let go of your project to apply tape.  The deskgrip dispensers that are included in the package are much more useful to me.  You temporarily attach them to your desk, table, etc.  and they stay put, making it extremely handy.  The bottom is a non-skid material, easily movable, nothing sticky that would ruin your surface.  I like these much better and find them very useful.  I have one in my craft room and the other at my office desk.  I would definitely buy more of the deskgrip type because I find myself using them much more often that I thought I would.  One thing I especially like about this kit is that the pieces of tape are precut, ready to apply.  There are plenty of extra refills included, too.  Overall, it's a very handy little kit, and would be helpful to kids that you don't want near tape dispenser blades and older people who might have trouble with arthritis.  I'll still use my heavy duty tape dispenser most often, but these will definitely be used frequently as well."
1430,"Nice, practical envelopes.  I don't particularly like licking envelopes, so I really like that these are self-sticking.  Simply pull off the strip, and voila!  You're done!  Good quality, would buy again."
1430,"I love these little post it note holders!  They are extremely handy and useful. I particularly like that they have a place to keep a pen or pencil.  I'm always looking for paper and pens when an idea pops into my head, so it's nice to have both the paper and writing utensil in one convenient spot.  I have one of these sitting on my desk and another in my craft room.  I'm constantly jotting things down (if I don't, I usually forget).  I didn't use the included hanging strips, although I do think I'll buy some more and hang some on my fridge.  They'd also be handy in the car.  Actually, I can't think of anywhere I couldn't use them.  They come in a set of two.  The Post Its are colorful, one pink and one blue.  The containers are plain white, so I added Cath Kidston stickers to pretty them up a bit.  Now they're both useful AND cute!  You can never have enough Post It Notes around, especially if you tend to be forgetful like me."
1430,"These labels come in handy for organizing just about anything.  Unlike regular Post It Notes, these have the adhesive covering the entire back surface.  You can use them to label folders, boxes, etc.  They stick very well and are easy to remove, leaving no sticky residue.  There are 100 labels included in all, in pink and green.  I use them for many things, especially for organizing my zillions of knitting books and supplies.  They're also good for labeling notebooks, binders, food containers, etc.  Good product."
1430,"I have a bit of a Post It Note habit...I use them constantly for everything.  This adhesive roll is great to have around.  It's on a tape dispenser type roll, and allows you to tear of notes of any size.  Tiny or long, whichever you want.  Good for marking my place in books and articles.  Obviously, it isn't necessary to have Post-Its on a roll.  Tearing the  regular ones will do.  But it's nice having this little roll around.  Necessary?  No.  Handy?  Yes."
658,"Extremely durable, not too sticky but still hold great. Bright, attractive color. Great for reminders/organizing your workflow. I do think the price is too high, though, for the product."
658,"This is not very comfortable and feels really cheap. It definitely seems durable, but it does little to relieve pain or discomfort. I am generally not a fan of 3M, so I would seek other brands before deciding to buy something like this. Kind of a waste of money, in my opinion."
658,"These pouches are fantastic -- great quality and hold up very well over time. Not a problem at all using them with my laminator. Overall, no complaints at all!"
658,"Superior stick -- the applicator is so much easier to use than most brands. It dries rather quickly, and the stick lasts. Unfortunately, like all super glues, it doesn't work on all surfaces, so I would definitely recommend shopping around (maybe even asking a hardware store clerk) to make sure that this super glue is right for the surface you're using. Generally speaking, though, Scotch is always reliable."
658,"These things are SO MUCH more convenient than dealing with regular file labels. You can just stick a new label over an old folder, and it's easy as that! No need to spend time pushing a little piece of paper in between that stupid piece of plastic anymore!"
658,Incredibly bright labels. Adhesive is strong. Text printed on these labels looks bold and bright. Great value -- couldn't ask for more for the price!
658,"This product gets an A+ for convenience, but I can't help but wonder if it's worth the cost of the refills. I could just as easily use regular tape and pre-cut it into strips on the edge of a table.That being said, the dispenser itself is durable, and the tape pops up quickly and without hassle.A great gadget for the holidays, but it won't be replacing my regular old-fashioned tape dispenser anytime soon."
658,Very sturdy paper and very easy to print and assemble. Lots of tickets for the price. Very easy to customize and much better than other alternatives. Another great Avery product.
658,"These labels are super sticky on most surfaces. Don't leave a residue, and easy to come off. However, I do think they are a bit overpriced, so I would only buy them again when I really need a label that is fully adhesive instead of having only one adhesive strip on the upper back."
658,"This binder is large, durable and best of all SUPER CHEAP compared to similar items at office supply stores. Love the EZ-turn ring and pockets on the inside.Definitely a must-buy for the price."
658,"Great concept. Sticks to the wall perfectly, and the notes pop out easily. 5 stars."
658,"These things are awesome -- the stickiness seems to last forever! None of my labels have fallen off any surface I've placed them on. I love that the back is fully adhesive, so the labels lay flat on the surface. Wonderful labels!"
71,"Every Avery label I have ever tried I loved and this one is no different.  Instead of writing on your file folders, just insert these correctly into your inkjet or laser printer, select the Avery 5366 template, type in what you want, and print.  The labels can fit three lines of text comfortably if you were planning to use them as address labels instead of just for folders.  However, the length is really designed for folders. Of course if you decrease your font size, you might be able to squeeze a fourth line on the label.MS Word 2007 already has the template for these labels.  You can download the template from the Avery site if your version of Word doesn't have this template by default."
71,"I downloaded the Avery 5163 template and Avery wizard for MS Word from the Avery site and used that template with these 3M labels.  Of course, you can go to the 3M site and use their template as well.The instruction sheet in the package provides instructions for both laser and inkjet printers.  However, you need to use the type of printer these labels were designed for which is noted on the outside of the package. Since I received the laser labels, this is the type of printer I tested them with. They printed perfectly on the laser printer even when printing them using the automatic paper feeder.What is nice about these labels is that they are large enough for small to medium boxes yet still small enough to fit on a business envelope in a pinch."
71,"I love Avery products and this ticket stock is fantastic.  I have a Brother color laser printer connected to my Windows Vista machine and it fed through the printer fine and goes through the duplexer without falling apart. Also, the ticket stubs come apart wonderfully after printing.  Where Avery seriously fails is in the ticket template design.I had wanted to try this on both an inkjet and laser printer since it is rated for both. Therefore, I planned on using my boyfriend's inkjet printer with his MAC OS machine.  However, for some reason I was unable to locate the 16154 label at avery.com/print using Safari so I nixed that idea.  So when I got home I tried my computer and printer.  At home with IE 9 I was able to load the template. The problem is the template is not totally intuitive and that started the below problems:- I was only able to edit either all the tickets or one ticket at a time.  What I really wanted to do was edit several tickets at a time because I wanted a quantity of 3, 3, 2, and 2 tickets all with different designs on the same page. I had to do that individually unfortunately.- After I thought I was finished, I previewed the results and got a PDF to print.  However, the first set of tickets printed in black and white and the PDF printer settings were grayed out for the color so I could not change the options in the dialog box.  I had to cancel out and reload the PDF for some reason and then I got the option to change to color.  However, for a while I was fussing with my printer thinking the problem was on my end when it wasn't.- Once I was able to change the print settings in the PDF to color, I printed all the tickets. That is when I noticed another problem.- I made a mistake and although I thought I was done when I previewed my tickets, I did not realize a ticket numbering sequence was missing.  There was nothing that warned me I wasn't done. However, I did not notice this until I used up all 20 sheets in the package and I went to separate the tickets - now I'll have to number both sections by hand.- I also feel that while the template is created and before printing starts, there should be a warning to remind users to insert card stock correctly - just in case.In summary, the product itself is of high quality but because the template is so poorly designed and non-intuitive, there will be a lot of frustration and waste of product until some controls are instituted to ensure one doesn't forget anything and ease of use is refined.  The card stock gets 5 stars and template gets 1 star from me."
71,"It seems that manufacturers are constantly inventing new conveniences and this can be considered one of them.  This pop-up tape dispenser with refills comes with two handband dispensers, two deskgrips, and six refills that each contain 75 2-inch pieces of tape.I like that the handband dispensers fit snugly around your hand or wrist, are adjustable, are easy to use, are refillable, and permit you to dispense pieces of tape with only one hand.  The only thing I didn't like is that it was difficult to open the dispenser to insert the refills. I almost broke one of the dispensers trying to open it. If they could make the dispenser easier to open that would be great.I also like that the deskgrip dispensers use a suction cup to affix to a work surface so that you can dispense tape with one hand. I found that if I don't pull the tape out quickly, the suction never held (at least not on my counter or desk) and the deskgrip wound up hanging in mid-air by the tape.  However, if I pulled quickly, the suction held most of the time.  I feel this could be improved on by creating better suction and also by making these deskgrip's refillable--which currently they are not.The value you receive from purchasing these tape dispensers and strips for gift wrapping or other jobs is convenience not cost savings.  It is certainly a lot cheaper per inch to use roll tape.  I also don't think it's so good for the environment to have to throw out the deskgrips after the two refills are spent.  However, these dispensers are certainly useful in many situations and with a little improvement can be a five star product when used for the right purpose. For instance, this would be great for children so they don't cut themselves on the roll tape dispensers or use so much tape.  They are also good for disabled people who have limited leverage or use of only one arm and they are great for able-bodied people for ease of use or convenience purposes."
71,"I really like these labels.  You can stick them to almost anything and then pull them off without leaving an residue.  For instance, I like to stick them to my potted plants to mark what plant I have growing in the pot.Its use is limitless and purpose numerous.  These are like sticky post it notes with about an 1/4 inch non-stick area that lets you remove the label if you change your mind.  It's a great idea and great product."
71,"These medium boxes are superb.  At 8 per pack, the cost is $3.81 per box at the current price of $30.48, so to me that is slightly expensive since it's only cardboard.PROS- Easy Assembly - as soon as you open the box, the bottom sort of ""snaps"" into place.  The top is numbered so you can fold them in the order shown and then tuck the flaps under the folds.  So EASY and no tape needed!- Sturdy and strong- Spacious - these boxes are bigger than I expected and would easily fit three or four dutch ovens as well as some other odds and ends.- Handles - the handles are great for carrying as opposed to some other boxes you buyCONS- Just slightly expensive; I would pay no more than $3.20 per box"
71,"I love this wrist rest!!!!!!!!!!!!!!PROS:- Extremely comfortable- Supports your arms / wrists without pain- Provides a great surface area (19"" long) for resting- Feels like leather (even though it's not) because it's so soft- Non-slip backing holds the gel wrist rest in place- Inhibits growth of bacteria and such due to being antimicrobial (of couse, I haven't had this long enough to verify this)CONS:- None"
71,"The title says it all.  When giftwrapping with this tape it is practically invisible (no tape is totally invisible) and has a non-gloss finish you can write on.I have both the Duck Brand tape (Duck Brand Invisible Tape, 3/4 x 350 Inches, 3-Pack in Hand-held Dispensers, 684937) and this one and each works comparatively well. The only difference I found between these two brands is that this one was a smaller roll with less tape and the cutting edge on the dispenser was not as sharp.  Other than this, it is a great purchase if you are in the market for invisible tape with a matte finish for giftwrapping and other taping chores."
71,"These NoteTabs are the length and width of a shopping list note pad except that they have several perforated sections, are made of a clear see-through plastic-like material, and have a tab on top.Except for the tab part (which looks like the tab on a binder divider), the rest of the sheet has a ""post-it type"" sticky background so that you can stick the entire length of the NoteTab to your book or item. You can also separate the perforated sections and stick them other places on the page or use them separately elsewhere.These NoteTabs appear to have a limited use.  The tab is good for marking sections of a document or book that you want to get to quickly; so it acts like a binder divider.  You can also write on that tab easily with a pen or marker.  However, the see-through sections should be written on with a marker because it's hard to write on them with a pen.  I found these sections to be good for highlighting over an area of a book with a highlighter.  For instance, if you borrowed someone's book and didn't want to mark it up, you could easily stick these clear sections to a portion of a page and then use your highlighter to highlight over the clear plastic.  You can then remove the NoteTabs without leaving any residue and reuse them if you didn't write on them or highlight over them.Other than highlighting over sections of text or using the top portion with the tab to act like binder dividers in a book, I honestly see no useful purpose for these NoteTabs. This product is certainly not something I have use for."
71,"This laminator is the low volume unit for home use.  This 9 inch 1000L takes a maximum document pouch of 9"" x 14-1/2"" which means a letter or legal-sized document can be laminated depending on the lamination pouches purchased.  There are other versions of this laminator that allow for a lamination size of 11""x17"". As per the manual, there's a 1100L 9 inch and also a 1000L, 3000L, 5000L, and 5100L that laminates up to 11""x17"" all with different features.  As the model numbers go up, the higher the volume the laminator can handle.This personal version is so, so simple to setup and use that I don't think it's possible to make it any easier. Just plug it in, let it warm up for 5 minutes (it seemed to take less time to warm up), insert your document flush against the sealed edge of the laminating sheet and then feed the sealed edge of the laminating sheet through the guides on the machine. The laminator will then automatically feed the sheet through at a slow pace until the process is completed. The sealed document passes out the other end.There are few caveats to keep in mind:1 - Always use the entire 9"" x 11-1/2"" or 9""x 14-1/2"" sheet even for small jobs, then cut it down to size after the sheet is sealed.  Of course, if only a car registration is being laminated then most of the sheet will be wasted.2 - The manual says to regularly feed a cleaning card or sheet of paper through the laminator to clean the rollers.  Although the manual does not specify this, always use a clean sheet of paper with no type or marks of any kind otherwise the heat will transfer the type onto the rollers. Trust me as I tried it with a sheet that had type on it just to see if what I expected would happen. Sure enough, it smeared the ink all over the rollers.  I then had to feed three plain sheets of paper through the machine to clean it.  The vendor needs to update the manual to specifically warn against using anything but an absolutely clean piece of paper.  Also, they should define regularly.  I take it to mean after every daily session; meaning right before you are going shut off the laminator for the day.3 - If the paper that was inserted between the laminating pouch is not completely smooth and crease-free, then any crease will be reflected in the completed project.4 - The laminator pouches must be purchased separately. Acco Brands recommends the Swingline GBC lamination pouches with this unit. I reviewed this with a 9"" x 11-1/2"" set of pouches.In summary, this laminator does the job and is very easy to use. The manual is short and also mostly easy to understand."
71,"These durable filing tabs are a fanstastic idea that needs more work.What I like about them is:- These tabs are tough.  It was as if I put a binder separator to mark the pages of my book.- The lower portion is clear so it did not cover any writing on the page I stuck it to unlike their other productPost-it Note Tab, 3.37 x 2.75 Inch, Green and Blue (2200-GB).- I was able to remove the tab easily and without any damage to the page.- I was able to write both on the colored and clear part of the tab.What I really dislike is:- I used a ballpoint pen to write on both the top and bottom of the tab and the top part smeared even after 20 minutes of drying.  Yet the clear part never smeared.- The cost is almost .17 cents per sheet and there are only 24 per pack at the current price of $3.99.If Post-it solved the smearing problem, I would have rated this product 4 stars (taking off 1 star for the high cost).  If they solved both the smearing problem and lowered the cost to about $2.00 per pack, I would have rated this product 5 stars because these easily turn a book, binder, file folder, etc. into a nicely separated ""document"" without the expense of having to purchase binder separators.  However, because the ink smears for about 30 minutes after writing on the top part of the tab, I wouldn't even consider purchasing these until they have been reengineered.  Personally I don't like the messy look of smeared ink not to mention the difficulty in reading smudgy writing."
71,"The adhesive dot roller rolls a light coating of adhesive dots over the item you want to secure. For instance, it can be used to close envelopes that won't stick, attach ""kid art"" to the fridge, stick items to a scrap book, seal wrapping paper in limited circumstances, etc.  However, the sticking power is not a strong as a Post-it so, for instance, when I removed a piece of paper from the fridge and then tried to ""post it"" up again with the same coating of dots it fell.It would be easy to use up this roll with only a few applications if you continued to apply the dots across the entire edges of the product you are sticking.  Also, I feel the price of the refills (currently at $4.99) each is expensive for what this is. The dot roller is a neat invention that is a bit expensive to me."
71,"You can use these NoteTabs instead of binder dividers orPost-it Flags Value Pack, Assorted Colors, 280 Page Flags and 48 Arrows of 0.5 Inch per Pack (683-VAD1)to signify a new section in your binder or highlight an important note in your book or paperwork.These NoteTabs act like the tab part of a manila folder and allow you to write all over them (on the tab or colored part as well as the clear part). They are also sturdier than the Post-it Flags. What a wonderful and useful product this is."
71,"These clear adhesive gel-like squares are somewhat useful for hanging anything a pound or under by remembering to use one square for each 1/4 pound you are hanging but never exceed hanging a pound in total.I tried to hang a wooden mask to a wall that was .38 pound using two tabs.  Unfortunately, the item fell after 25 minutes. Obviously because each tab was unable to fully touch the wall due to the slightly concave nature of the mask, this was the main reason it fell even though when I first put the mask on the wall it seemed secure despite this fact.  However, because the adhesive on the tab is not real sticky, even using four tabs did not help the mask stick--(that's 4 tabs stuck 1/2 halfway to the wall which would be equivalent to 2 tabs for an object a little over 1/4 pound).I also used TWO TABS EACH to hang up two pictures that were in a plastic envelope. Each picture was .28 pounds.  They are still sticking to the wall and I expect they will remain there.The tabs are definitely easily removable and leave no mark.  However, they are not very adhesive and I disagree that you can use them again and again like the package states.  The reason is I tried reusing the tabs from the mask but they wouldn't work because my fingerprints that adhered to the tab caused them to lose their effectiveness.In summary, besides the usual use of hanging light items, I also recommend these for the following applications (please test on an inconspicuous area first before applying, of course):- Using them to hold down or cushion objects on a dresser. If you have cats that like to knock things around, you can affix a tab(s) underneath an item to cushion it and also give it a little ""sticktuitiveness.""- Using them to cushion the point where cabinet doors and drawers meet.- Using them to keep placements in place on a bare table.- Using them on the bottom of one corner of any wall pictures or artwork to keep the artwork straight on the wall.Overall, I think these tabs definitely have a purpose, but they are not sticky enough for some applications and they are not always reusable if dust, fingerprints, and hair become affixed to the tabs."
71,It is refreshing to finally have the ability to press a button and start highlighting without having to mess with a cap.PROS:- These highlighters come in their own pouch which helps protect them from the air and keeps them organized.- They come in eight wonderful colors.- The highlighter tip is protected by a retractable plastic cover when not extended.- One click is all it takes to start highlighting.CONS:- The dark blue color is too dark for me to use as a highlighter because it's hard to read the text that's been highlighted.- The width of the felt tip is a little narrow.Overall I love these highlighters. Time will tell if they dry out quicker than the other highlighters with the cap. I'll be sure to update my post if they do.
71,"This ""Post-it Pop-up Notes Dispenser"" is another option for those who love Post-it notes. The Post-its dispense like tissues out of a tissue box except that it is difficult to dispense the first few sheets.  Also, once you remove one sheet, the other sheet hangs over the note holder.  The pen holder on the side is a nice touch but it's not deep enough and it's too wide so the pens I tried just tilted out over the holder.You apply this holder to the wall, fridge, or another clean surface with a velcro and adhesive ""tape.""  Overall, I think this is a neat idea if you want another type gadget to hold your Post-its; however, the pen holder and ease of dispensing could use some improvement."
813,"I give the tape itself 5 stars -it is fantastic, and is really the best tape to use on wrapping paper, because it does a great job of disappearing.  It is MUCH better, in fact, than the typical Scotch tape which can be removed and reused if not put on correctly --and which is not fully see through.  Though that tape also does a great job when used for wrapping, the Satin Finish tape is better.The only problem I had is that I was really surprised at how little tape came on each of these three rolls; it was ridiculous.  I had a ""regular"" single roll of Scotch Satin Tape and the tape on THAT roll was at LEAST three times the diameter of the tape on each of these 3-pack rolls.  So, the bottom line is that these three rolls of tape seem to have less tape than a single roll of the regular sized Scotch Satin Tape.  Basically if you like to have more rolls of tape lying around (for example, useful if other people are helping you wrap) AND the three rolls are cheaper, together, than a single roll, then go for the three rolls.  If, however, you like having less clutter, less wasting of resources (more plastic going into the garbage), and NOT running out of tape in the middle of wrapping, go for the single roll.  (The single roll also has the advantage of having a stronger case -and is sealed on both the front and the back.You can't go wrong with the quality of this product, just with the amount of waste, and the amount of tape you get for your money.Recommended as a single roll.  Not recommended as a three pack unless multiple people are wrapping at the same time."
813,"Well, I struggled a bit to write a review for these restickable labels.  I couldn't really see why they needed to be made -after all they aren't so much different from a lot of other similar items on the market.  They are basically thin post-it notes with adhesive along the entire back of the paper, instead of just the top third.What do the labels do well? They are very easy to pull off and restick.  They also seem to maintain the adhesive over multiple uses over multiple days.  I am not sure why you would need to label something and then remove and restick it several times, but if you needed to, you could.  (Perhaps they would find a more common use in the office, where one might want to temporarily label a file until the final file name could be determined?)Having both post-it notes and this product, I find that I don't use the labels any more than I would post-it notes, but if I needed to label something that I didn't want to peel/fall off by mistake, then I would use the labels.  For example, sometimes when I use a post-it note and stick it vertically on something it curls up at the edges, and eventually falls off. In this case I might choose the label instead because there is no way that the label would fall off.  On the other hand, as post-it notes are generally bigger, if I just wanted to leave a casual note for myself or someone else, then I would probably use a post-it note instead.A nice product but not an essential one; it works just as intended."
813,"If you are someone who needs to use small strips of tape, and pulling them out one handed is a benefit to you, then this is a product for you.  If you just need clear tape and have both hands available, it is much more cost effective to just buy a standard roll of tape.The tape strips are exactly two inches long, and they come out of the product very easily.  With the innovative suction cup on the base (which provides suction, yet can be easily pushed around a desk) the product does not disappoint mechanically in any way.HOWEVER, for the price you pay, I would have expected to get more tape.  It looks like you get 1/5 the amount of tape you'd get with a standard roll.  As such, I cannot really recommend this product for everyone.  You need at least double the tape to make it worthwhile.That being said, if you are a crafter/scrapbooker and this type of tape delivery appeals to you, you won't be disappointed -it is a solid product."
813,"This product is a solid value, especially around the Christmas season.The problem with some of these pre-cut tape thingies is that you get a dispenser and one tape, and you overpay for replacement tapes, often when you run out unexpectedly at an inopportune time.  (But come to think of it, isn't anytime you run out an inopportune time?)This time, however, Scotch gets it right.  You get TWO double dispensers, TWO hand dispensers, and FOUR EXTRA precut tapes, at a reasonable price.  These four extra precut tapes are in addition to the four precut tapes already in the double dispeners, and the two tapes you'll put in the two single wrist dispensers.  (In other words you get ten tapes overall.  You get six extra precut tapes -and four additional tapes already in the dispensers, but two of the extra tapes need to go in the wrist dispensers).I don't know if it is an improvement to have a double dispenser instead of a single dispenser, but the one advantage is that you'll never run out of tape unexpectedly, because when you've used one dispenser you'll have another one right next to it, in the same plastic shell.  On the other hand, however, the double dispenser is a little trickier to pull the tapes out of, as you'll have to reverse the direction of your pull each time --versus with a single dispenser which pushes the tape straight up, and requires you to pull straight up, instead of side to side.The wrist dispensers are nice, too.  You have an adjustable and comfortable elastic band which allows you to put the dispenser on your wrist and grab precut slices of tape when you need it.  Perfect for wrapping presents quickly, and without another person to help.I actually really like this set and think it is a fine addition to the Christmas wrapping season.  And the best thing is that up to four people can use this at once, as each can have their own tape dispenser.Pretty cool."
813,"This product seems more born of marketing than of necessity.  Supposedly you stick this on the back of your laptop, and then when you need to make a note you'll find a pen, pull off a post it note, and stick it somewhere... (Where exactly are you suppoed to stick it? aren't you supposed to be mobile? will you stick it on the laptop? on your person? or if you are giving it to someone wouldn't it be better if it wasn't sticky on the back so that it wouldn't get covered with lint in their pocket or stuck to something else in their purse?) Anyway, I wouldn't dare uglify my laptop by sticking one of these cheap looking paper dispensers on the back.  I mean, seriously! If you can find a pen you can probably find another sort of note in your backpack as well...In any case, I am also disappointed at the lack of value that these provide -you don't get a lot of post it notes for what you pay for.  I think you are better off purchasing regular post it notes, or something more portable that you don't have to stick to a hard item, and use those instead.HOWEVER, all that being said, there IS a use for these.  I think they are a great idea to put on a fridge, or on a desk hutch.  Both are places which provide an ample sticking surface, which are probably near some sort of writing instrument, and which are in a place where the notes might actually serve a purpose.  I think the marketing gurus would have been better served going this route instead of the white-elephant-ruin-the-lines-of-my-laptop-look.Not recommended for the laptop, but fine for the fridge."
813,"I was really impressed with these boxes.  I use ""Banker's Boxes"" all the time, and just assumed these ""Moving Boxes"" would be the same type of thing.  I was pleasantly surprised when I found how different these boxes were, and I immediately saw some great benefits depending on what you were using them for.Well, these Moving Boxes are NOT Banker's Boxes, and while I think Banker's Boxes excel at the purpose of STORAGE, I think these boxes truly are dedicated to the singular task of MOVING your possessions.Here is a comparison of the two styles:The Banker's Boxes were 16 inches long, 13 inches wide, and 10 inches high.The Moving Boxes were 17 inches long, 12.25 inches wide, and 12.5 inches high.The Banker's Boxes were not as tall, and were slightly shorter lengthwise.  This meant that they fit more comfortably in my closet where I store things.  The Moving Boxes, on the other hand were a little larger and probably wouldn't fit the way I would want in my closet, and for all storage related purposes I would probably go for the Banker's Boxes.  In addition, the tops of the moving boxes are not flat like the Banker's Boxes -they have a cardboard fold on the top of the box, so there is double cardboard for half of the top, and single cardboard for the other half.  Therefore, two boxes on top of each other (long term) might not be quite as stable -especially since they are taller.In addition, because of this fold, and of the way they lock, Moving Boxes don't open quite as easily or quickly as Banker's Boxes -whose tops come off with the flick of a finger.However, the Moving Boxes really shone in a couple  of areas:1) Easy to make: They were SUPER easy to put together; a lot easier than Banker's Boxes, and you can save time using them (over Banker's Boxes) -especially with people who haven't put together boxes before.  The Moving Boxes were a single piece of cardboard, and by a few quick motions, turned into a full box with a built in top.  The Banker's Boxes take at least twice as long to put together (because you have to make the tops and the bottoms separately), and when you are using them for moving, this can add some time -especially when you are talking 20+ boxes.2) No tape: The other huge advantage for Moving Boxes boxes is that they do not require tape.  ""Well"", you might say, ""Banker's Boxes don't require tape either"".  Yes and no.  Banker's Boxes don't require tape for storage, but if you have ever moved an entire apartment with Banker's Boxes, and you've been stacking them high to move them, and any wind picks up, you might see the tops fly off, and end up running down the street to get them.  (I ended up putting tape on all the tops of my Banker's Boxes so that this didn't happen, and this took even more time and materials.)  The Moving Boxes, however, have an innovative design which folds the top down upon itself, locking it tight, (providing even more cushioning for the hand holes), making it very unlikely the top would fly off in the wind.3) Re-use: Are you one of those people who like to take apart boxes after a move, compress them flat, and use them later on? Then you'll love the Moving Boxes.  Unlike the two piece Banker's Boxes, these Moving Boxes are only a single piece -they are much easier to take apart, store, and reuse later.  (Taking apart the tops of the Banker's Boxes and storing them along with the bottoms is a little bit of a pain.)4) Sturdiness: The Moving Boxes are definitely more sturdy.  The cardboard is thicker, and they would definitely not get as beat up as the Banker's Boxes if you are moving them around a lot.  I would trust my delicate possessions more readily to the Moving Boxes than to the Banker's Boxes.So, all in all, if you are looking to MOVE, then these Moving Boxes are fantastic.  If you just want boxes for STORAGE only, I would probably go for banker's boxes.  And if you really want something that does both, you could go either way and be fine."
813,"Having had to move several times in the past five years I've put together my share of ""banker's boxes"".  With these I was looking forward to an improved version of the product -and one that looked more stylish and rugged than the typical box.I think the boxes are fine, and have no major flaws, but they are not all I had hoped them to be.  First, they were a little harder to put together than usual due to a very small -half centimeter- fold that was required to create a ""lip"" on one of the pieces of cardboard (which was then folded under another piece of cardboard).  It was also difficult to see this fold in the instructions, and I had to puzzle it through a couple of times until I understood how the box was to be made.  (It also took longer than I wanted to read and reread the instructions to find out how exactly the plastic piece was supposed to be secured.)  And then, I realized that the box wasn't quite fitting the way I wanted -even after following the instructions three times, and doing all the folds necessary-- as the pieces were a little too cramped, causing the internal parts of the box to warp a bit.  Next, as my wife noted, even though the boxes looked stylish, and had easy to use plastic hand grips, the boxes were permanently unsealed where the hand holes were, preventing one from using the box to (as shown in the picture!) store CLOTHES, as dust or insects would get in there, and this would make the box useless in an attic or an unfinished basement.  And finally, I think the plastic sheet really is on the WRONG side of the box -as I believe one usually does not store boxes the short way in a closet, but the long way (with the short side facing you, not the long side).  You want to see in the window on the side that is closest to your eye when you pull it out of the closet, and I think that is th other side...So, some flaws, but if you can live with the fact that it is not sealed from the air, and you don't mind the plastic sheet in the middle of the box instead of the end, then I recommend this box overall.  Otherwise, stick with the regular banker boxes.PROS:+++ NICE DESIGN.  The boxes look stylish and can be used to store things out in the open without looking crummy.  It is a good look.++ HAND GRIPS ARE GOOD.  Plastic hand hold inserts make the boxes very easy to grip and lift (as well as pull out).++ SEE THROUGH WINDOW IS USEFULL.  If you look at the box sideways you can see inside without taking off the lid.CONS:-- HARDER TO PUT TOGETHER THAN USUAL.  It takes a few reads of the instructions and some testing before it comes naturally.-- BOX LETS IN LOTS OF OUTSIDE AIR/DUST.  The side holes are permanently open.  (Regular banker's boxes allow you to push the cardboard hand grip back in the hole, and even permanently tape it shut -which is what I do for storage in my basement to avoid dust.)Overall, recommended, but only as a stylish niche player."
813,"I was hoping for a better product than what this turned out to be: the paper is not as sticky as it should be, and it tends to curl -even with the extra strip of adhesive.  If you have a specific use for them, then give them a shot, but I will probably stick with something else (no pun intended!)**HINT: If you peel this product at an angle of 90 degrees differently than how you usually peel sticky notes, it will not curl nearly as much.  Pull it ACROSS the sticky strips, so that it is a long pull, and sticky the whole way, instead of just sticky at the beginning, and at the second sticky strip (on the last third of the paper)... This solves a lot of the problem (though it is harder to start the pull!)PROS+ STICKS TO TUBES.  This product works better than standard sticky notes when you stick it to a tube of some sort.+ NO CURLING -this only works if you pull it off from the SIDE, instead of the top or the bottom.  If you do it this way it will not curl.+ AFFILIATED WITH A CHARITY.  If you go for that sort of thing, this product participates with box tops for education.  From the package -""All Avery Sticky Notes have Box Tops for Education coupons, which you can use to help raise money for schools..."")+ NICE COLORS -good variety, semi-fluorescent green, pink, and orange (instead of the usual yellow or sky blue).CONS-NOT STICKY ENOUGH.  I compared this to a standard stack of Avery sticky notes (with the ""Stick'n"" technology) and my best guess is that the standard Avery sticky notes are about half again as sticky as these double stick notes, which could use a little more stickiness.-LOTS OF CURLING.  **See my note above about peeling off the note**.  If you pull these notes off the way you usually pull sticky notes off (from top to bottom, instead of from side to side), the note curls unacceptably, and really is worthless for what you need it for, because it will fall down in a day or so, and the note curls way more than single sticky strip post-it notes.If you are willing to try peeling it off lengthwise, then they are ok, but I think they need to make the paper thicker, so it doesn't curl as much. I will give this product three stars if you use it for curved surfaces and peel it without curling... but two stars, otherwise."
813,"I used these all the time for work and home, and I love them.For work I use them to mark where people need to sign documents, and to note what sections of the document need to be reviewed further.  I also write on the colored ends with a very thin sharpie with notes, and leave the document (and the sticky) in the permanent file.  (The nice thing about this is that whoever opens the file immediately sees the note, which may mark the section as ""travel"" or ""updated"" or ""contract"" or whatever topic is important to you.)Another nice thing about these is that they peel off really easily without damaging the paper beneath.  (At home I use these to mark sections in a magazine or a book that I want to show someone, and at work I may use them instead of a sticky note if I want a reminder to stick very securely to something like a computer screen or a phone handle.  Yes, the note is very small, but it can be useful!)More useful that I would have thought, and indispensable to those who need to gather and file multiple documents.Recommended for every office."
813,"I was really pleased with this product.Yes it took me about a minute to figure out -I was upside down- but once I realized the plastic cover (once retracted) should face the ground (versus the ceiling) it worked like a charm.If you've ever used correction tape, this follows the same principle.  Merely drag the tape where you want your glue to go, and it places multiple tiny glue dots in a straight line about a centimeter wide along your paper.  What a wonderful product for scrapbooking, or placing your pictures into albums.I highly recommend this product for children.  It is safer and less messy than glue, and you can't really screw it up.  Best of all, since the dots are really small and clean, they don't drip or ooze out of the area where you placed them -which makes them easier to use than glue (with no mess to clean up!)Yes the bond is less permanent than glue, and more like the glue from a post-it note, but this should be fine for most uses, and extremely desirable when you want to remove what you've glued to move it somewhere else.A very useful product.  Highly recommended."
813,"Superglue is usually a pain in the neck -it either clogs up your tube, so you really can't use it again once you've opened it, or you get a drippy, watery mess, which goes everywhere (because you squeezed too hard), which then ruins your clothes or sticks your fingers together...This glue is a nice compromise and worth trying to avoid both of those issues.  The applicator is like none of the other glue tubes that I've tried: both the sides have moveable/squeezable panels that look like large buttons, that allow you to squeeze, very gently, the perfect amount of glue out.  Additionally, the tip of the glue container looks just like an eye dropper --long and slender-- which allows you the ability to very delicately place exactly the amount of glue you need, precisely where you need it.PROS:+EASY START -The glue tube auto opens (by piercing the foil) just by screwing the top on to the glue --no need to poke it with a sharp object, or the reverse of the glue point-- just twist the top all the way down and the foil is pierced when the cap reaches the last turn.+EYEDROPPER CAPABILITY -this allows you very fine motor control, and is better than the 'toothpaste tube' style of superglue bottles.+EASY SQUEEZE CAPABILITY -the buttons on the side make this a breeze.  A gentle squeeze does the work, and less pressure equals less glue...+SUPER TIGHT SEAL -once you twist the top back on, the air ain't gettin' in there!CONS:-WATERY GLUE.  The glue is a very watery type of glue.  If you don't have a good seal the glue may slide off, because it moves as quickly and as smoothly as water.  You'll find through trial and error that there are some applications that will work better with more of a gel type glue, instead.)Overall the design of the bottle makes this product worth a try.  Recommended!"
813,"The way this ""whiteboard eraser"" was advertised you might think there was something different about it --that is, when compared to a standard magic eraser.  The only difference that I could see was that the handle was slightly curved, which, as the packaging stated, ""provides comfortable grip for easy cleaning"".So basically it is your run of the mill magic eraser.  Now don't get me wrong, I love them, and I find them very useful for getting marks off of painted walls, but I don't see any difference between this and any other version.Now on to how it works on whiteboard...From the best that I can tell the pacakage implies that no sprays or cleaners (or water) are needed to clean regular whiteboards with regular markers.  Well this didn't work at all -a complete failure.  (To be fair, though, the whiteboard had ink on it that was there a couple of months.  So it was completely dry, but it was NOT permanent ink.)The packaging also states that you can ""add water to erase most permanent marker, ghosting and residue"".  So when I added water and I lightly brushed the board I was also a little disappointed that the ink really didn't come off very easily, like it might with spray and a towel.  But then I remembered, you have to apply pressure with magic erasers and let the friction wear away the ink and the sponge at the same time.  And when I did it this way the ink came right off, like a dream.  Wow, that combination really worked.So, does it work? when you add water, and you push down solidly, yes, it works extremely well -and I don't doubt it also works great for permanent markers.Is it any better than a standard magic eraser? No, so I say buy the cheapest magic eraser and it will clean whiteboards, walls, or whatever just as well as this one.  Recommended."
813,"Though these weren't EXACTLY as sticky as the 3M standard sticky notes, I thought these did a pretty good job.  They curl a bit when you pull them off so you have to pay attention to rubbing the part of the note with the glue beneath it, to form a seal against what you are sticking, or it might curl off and blow away if brushed against.However, that aside, they are fine.  The colors are pleasing, and they provide a nice variety (instead of the boring yellow we are used to), and my pens seem to write on the notes very easily.No reason not to recommend, especially if the price is right."
417,"I really liked these tabs.  They are sturdy and very easy to use.  They can easily be peeled off and replaced.  I found these very useful in organizing my teaching materials into 3-ring binders.  I highly recommend these for home, school and office applications!"
417,"Useful and reliable.  I am not sure why but ink does not tend to smear on these labels like it does on others I have purchased.  Bright white, nice convenient size.  Recommended over Avery."
417,"The tape works fine and the dispenser works fine--especially when compared to those disposable tape varieties.  I just don't really find this product useful.  Unfortunately all projects do not require the same length of tape.  I find that my trusty old Scotch desktop tape dispenser is still my best best.  I can dispense tape at any length I need, the dispenser can be moved anywhere (including capreted floors) to be used conveniently, and it is MUCH more economical than the pop-up version.  Refills for the pop-up are much more expense than popping in a new roll of tape.  I never found dispensing tape from the old-fashioned dispenser to be troublesome so this product does not have any true value for me personally.  I'd recommend passing this one by."
417,"Love these and there are so many ways that they can be used.  It was a bit tricky finding and working with a template but it wasn't too bad.  Great for parties, events, classrooms."
417,"I was unimpressed with this product.  The labels are certainly removable but they are not sticky enough.  They do not adhere all that well with the first placement, let alone repositioning them elsewhere.  If you only want labels for a very temporary job and don't plan on reusing them, these would be a satisfactory choice.  I used them on file folders and regular paper.  Their impact on file folders was poor and on regular paper they were only OK."
417,"These are very convenient especially if you take your laptop from place to place.  The notes are contained within a protective cardboard case so edges don't get damaged and sheets don't pull off when you don't want them.  I think the product is a bit pricey, however.  Since I do not move my laptop around a lot, I don't think I will be replacing these."
417,"Convenient.  Comes with its own dispenser.  This is typical Post-it grade paper and is completely adhesive on the back--not just a strip.  This tape works great for temporry jobs that you may have.  It handles jobs I used to do with Post-It pads--I can quickly attach to anything and easily remove it as well but, unlike the pads, the whole piece adheres to where it is placed.  When using pads, only the strip sticke to surfaces and can easily be pulled off or get bent and folded as you work.  400 inches ensures that you will have a suffiecient supply on hand.  You can determine how long you want each piece to be and that is an excellent feature! No need to make pre-cut sizes fit your every need!"
417,"Very handy, sturdy and durable.  These are great for many applications in the home, office, or for school.  I like that more than one color is offered in this package.  They can easily be written on, applied and reapplied.  Great organizational tool to have on hand!"
417,"These are very convenient and easily come together.  They are sturdy and the size is very nice--it holds plenty without becoming too heavy.  I would be selective about what is packed in these, however.  The ""seal"" is not that secure.  It does remain closed but the seal is certainly not tight.  So, I use these for items like clothing, books, toys, pots.  If someone else will be moving these boxes around I would not put anything breakable in them.One great perk--they fold back up flat so they can be used again.  This along with not having to ""construct"" the box with tape on the bottom are the best features."
417,Very sturdy and made well.  It has clear-view covers ( and spine) so you can customize as needed.  Hinges open and close smoothly.  Better than your ordinary binder.
417,"I would like for these flags to have a bit more sticking endurance.  In general they work fine but if you need to move them around with a project they don't always hold up.  I like that there is variety in colors and that the colors are crisp and bright!  Overall, they are a good choice."
417,"I love for my files to be nice, neat and organized.  I used these tabs on standard files, inside my various binders, and on pocket folders.  These are a very nice, visible size--2 inches.  These are sturdy and come in an attractive variety of colors. These are now on my list of must-have supplies to always have on hand."
417,Another fine product.  These are sturdy and quite durable.  Tabs can easily be moved for resue in other applications.  They are great for 1/3 tab folders or to make your own dividers for binders.  Easy to write on.
417,I got these to use for labeling the mailbox unit in my classroom.  I previously used regular labels and always had to scrape remnants at the end of the year.  These do not have the adhesive power to last all year but I placed transparent tape over them.  Removal is a cinch now.  I want my the mailbox unit to last for many more years and this product helps me avoid the buildup from layers of label remains. They work well on temporary files that I must set up also.
417,Great address label.  Especially reliable stick-ability.  Good product for mailings and labeling  folders and such in the office.  Recommended
417,"When I first ordered this I thought I would get separate pads, all the same size, and that they were packaged to show the variety of colors. Each color grouping is its own individual size, however.  It is VERY easy to remove a sheet from whatever size you desire without compromising the entire pad.  What a fantastic idea!  One pad can fill multiple uses.  I often need larger than the traditional 3x3 size sheet and this pad provides that size yet allows me access to smaller sheets rather than wasting the larger sheets on smaller tasks. The area of the ""sticky"" band is quite sufficient as well.  I find these stick (and stay) better than the Post It brand I have used in the past.  It seems silly to be gushing about a sticky note pad but I absolutely love this item.  The colors are also attractive and look just fine when left out on a desktop.  I used to always keep my Post-It pad in a drawer."
417,"I really like the additional ""pocket"" on the inside of each cover.  This binder is lightweight yet durable.  I like that the rings close neatly into themselves rather than those claw-type rings.  The shape of the rings makes turning pages much easier.  I especially like that the binder is wider so that dividers do not hang over the side.  Printed material can be organized better with having extra pockets but print is still transferred.  Print can also be transferred in the clear-view covers so I am going to laminate my inserts first."
417,I like the crisp bold colors. The sticky band is wide enough to ensure good adhesion to multiple surfaces. Paper quality is durable.  I find this product to be superior to Post-It and will now be ordering Avery sticky pads.
1517,I have a couple of notebooks that I use where I have put the pages into plastic sleeves because I have to refer to them so often.  The problem is. . . regular dividers don't stick-out far enough on the edges because I use plastic sleeves.  But these tabs are the perfect thing so I know where each section is located!  I'm sure that they can be used for books and other things as well.
1517,"I've never been a really big fan of mechanical pencils.  But I've found that this one is different.  The lead is fine and sharp.  The writing is smooth.  Though it is plastic, there is a ""ring of rubber"" at the end which keeps your fingers slipping down, which I really like.  It's been a long time since I used a mechanical, and I'm glad that I gave this one a try."
1517,"This is cerainly a cool item for certain things. . . . but I haven't found out exactly what all I could be using it for.  I think it's going to be an ""ah-ha"" moment when that happens.  What really works beter for me are the Scotch Reusable Tabs.Scotch Reusable Tabs, 1 x 1 Inches, 18 Squares (R100)"
1517,"I like these labels because you can remove them.  If you've used others before, which you can not remove, then you either have to place another label on top or discard the folder.  This way it just makes it neater and easier to reuse file folders and save a tree. :-)"
1517,"These little things work GREAT!  There are 18 1"" X 1"" tabs in a package.  You simply peel them off and stick them on the corners of whatever it is that you want to place on the wall. . .window. . etc.  I was going to get a corkboard, but now I don't have to!  They show that you can reuse them again and again.  On the back it shows that if they get dirty you can was them with soap and water to ""refresh"" the stickiness!  Sounds like they will last a long time!  Though I've just been using them to put things on my wall, the package shows that they will stick on most flat surfaces including stainless steel, plastic, concrete, glass, wood and painted walls.  These are NOT going to hold-up large items.  They are more for cards, posters, photos and other lightweight items.  They are easy to remove also.  No more tape. . . no more pins. . no more putty (which stains). . . Great Item!Update. . . .FYI, for many items, like a sheet of paper, you really don't need to use an entire 1"" square.  You can easily cut them so they will go further as well."
1517,I like this brand over some other brands simply because there isn't a strip around the edge and center.  With other brands I usually remove this strip and sometimes the labels come off with it.  This way it just makes it easier to remove the labels.
1517,"These tabs are nice to use when you don't want to add the full-page tabs to something, or when that's not possible like for books.  They are very easy to use. . . a little thicker than regular paper."
1517,"These labels are nice.  I have nothing against them, per se. . . But you really can use a post-it not and do the same thing.  These have a little color and flair, so if you have something specific that these will work well with. . . great. . . otherwise, you might just want some post-it notes. :-)"
1517,"I haven't had any problems with these labels.  They are really a great size for lots of things including address labels, name badges, etc.  The way they are made, they don't have a strip down the middle, so they are a little easier to peel-off than some other brands."
1517,"Simple. . . easy. . . . no harsh chemicals. . . . and they work.  Just wet them, and you're ready to go.  I've used the bottles of ""spray stuff"" and it's much more expensive and doesn't to a better job. . . so I'm quite happy with this item."
1517,"The one thing about these envelopes that I really don't care for is the way you seal them.  The tout that you don't have to remove adhesive strips. . . which is true. . . but. . . adhesive strips are SO much faster and easier.  With these envelopes you have to lift a bottom flap, and then pull-down the top flap.  Though it sounds easy enough. . . you have to be careful, otherwise you'll rip the bottom flap.  I certainly don't think it would be very fast if you're sending lots of them out.  But for normal everyday use, they are fine."
1759,"This is a very comfortable pen to hold and to use, as the point moves with unusual smoothness. The crocodile patterned band in the middle adds elegance, as does the presentation box.  This would be a useful, inexpensive, but stylish gift for a coworker."
1759,"I run a home-based business and deal with a lot of paper. I use tons of those removable labels you stick on the side of the page. However, this doesn't work for papers where I don't want labels sticking out the side, so I have to write directly on the page and then print it out again when I want a clean copy. This wastes paper and is bad for the environment.Now I don't have to reprint those pages, because I have the Avery removable labels. They have a kind of tab on the side which enables me to easily peel the label off the backing. And to peel it off the paper page, if I don't remove the tab--which however can also be done.The one drawback is that my notes are often fairly long, my handwriting is large, but these labels are quite small. If a larger size is available, that's the one I personally would buy.Bear in mind that these labels are designed to be easily removable. They are not very suitable for permanent labeling. Because they are about the right size, I tried using them to label spice jars. Two of the jars were brand new, and I carefully cleaned and dried the jar I was recycling. Despite being firmly pressed down, all the labels were peeling off the jars within 20 minutes, without even being handled after I put them on the shelf."
1759,"These labels are designed for laser printer use. Templates to position addresses for mass printing can be downloaded from the manufacturer's website, and work with minimal adjustment. You need to follow the instructions in your laser printer manual, as well those provided with the labels, to make sure your printer will not jam. Once you've printed a sheet, fold it in the empty space in the middle, peel off the labels one by one, and apply them to the large envelopes or to the packages.You can also use the labels one at a time by typing on them with a typewriter, or writing on them by hand. I often use them this way to label the fronts and spines of the numerous three-ring binders in my office."
1759,"I got this binder in the green and liked it so much I went back and chose this Wedgewood blue one.  I find myself appreciating the wraparound, clear plastic slipcover more than I expected. I print out a lot of public domain books from the Internet, and usually have to write the title and author inelegantly on sticky labels.  With this binder, I can print off a title page and slip it into the front, print off the title and slip it into the spine, and if I want I can slip a relevant page into the back as well.  The D-ring binders are sturdy, and the fold-out of the front cover and spine enables me to stuff in more pages than I would without the fold-out."
1759,"This is a narrow binder, so it doesn&#8217;t really need the fold-out spine/front (which it has) or D-rings (which it does not have). The clear plastic pockets on the inside are useful for stray extra papers. Also useful is the clear plastic cover, which enables you to slide in your own, full-sized cover sheets in front and back instead of pasting on a label that will peel itself off. The lever at the bottom that opens all three rings at once is not a new feature, but it does open them with less pressure than is usual for other binders."
1759,"I've never had any problem with my regular sticky notes (those with only one strip of adhesive, on one edge) lying flat.  Then again, I only use sticky notes for temporary notes or flags.  The adhesive on these is just the same as always. In other words, it is designed to be temporary so you can peel the note off.  These are still not permanent labels. So I'm not sure I've gained anything from getting notes with two strips of adhesive . . . your mileage may vary."
1759,"This package of 200 sticky notes came with a recommendation for an Avery web page purporting to explain more about sticky notes.  Curious as to what tech support is needed for sticky notes, I visited the page. It's just marketing, but hey, who needs tech support for something as simple as these?  At 3"" x 3"", they are conveniently sized for short notes, self-reminders, or just to flag a page (which is how I usually use them)."
1759,"For me, these labels have one very specialized use: As sturdy, long-term markers in reference books where I often need to consult the same sections. They are also excellent for labeling the tabs of file folders, but I don't use them that way because I'm a slob. What I have on paper instead of in an electronic file, I throw in a used manila folder, cross out the last label scrawled across the front, and scrawl on a new one. Your mileage may vary."
1759,"These NoteTabs are good for temporarily dividing large documents, or separating several documents in a stack, without punching them, putting them in a three-ring binder, and adding those cardboard dividers with colored tabs. You just write on the NoteTab (if desired), stick it on the page, and pull it off when you're done. The tab is large but you can see text through it. The tabs pull off easily enough that you can to re-use them a few times."
1759,"This neat little device lays down dots of adhesive in a straight or curved line as desired, which form a strong bond between pieces of paper. The marketing says it is useful for many home and office applications. Its uses for scrapbookers are obvious, and also, kids will find many craft projects to use it on. Frankly, I'm hard pressed to think of ways it can be used in the office, or at least my office. But for home use it's handy to have around for the same purposes for which you'd use a glue stick."
1759,"Suppose you have a large paper document, or several related documents. You want to quickly identify places in the document(s) as if they were in a three-ring binder, but without punching holes in them, putting them in the binder, and adding cardboard dividers with colored tabs. That's what these NoteTabs are for. You can write on them, and pull them off when you're done. Using different colors helps with organization."
1759,"The size of the sticky note I want to use, at any given time, depends on whether I want to write text on it and how much. But, it's awkward to use a note that's too large, since it covers part of the page it is stuck on, possibly concealing text or illustrations in a book, report, etc. On occasion I've resorted to tearing large notes in half and using both halves, to get smaller ones without wasting paper. With this pad, I don't need to. It includes five sizes, ranging from 3 inches by 3 inches, to 3 inches by 5 inches. Additionally, five bright colors (orange, yellow, lime green, blue, and magenta) enable you to color-code notes."
1759,"These are fairly standard, self-seal, business-sized, white envelopes. The paper has a blue-patterned interior designed to conceal the text on the checks, documents, etc., enclosed in the envelope. The paper is exceptionally weak. Even if it does not tear in several places as the sender lifts the flap that covers the adhesive (and that prevents the envelope from being self-sealed before it's even used), it will tear in several places as the recipient opens the envelope. I failed to see any red letters on opening the envelope, but I don't especially care. One thing I do care about, however, is that the paper is so thin the envelopes crumple at the corners when I run them through my laser printer."
1759,"This is a large D-ring binder. It has the usual three rings, and metal levers on the top and bottom of the inside of the spine, to aid in opening and closing the rings. The case (or binding) folds out completely flat--front, back, and spine--which aids in paging through the large volume of paper this binder will hold. There are two plastic pockets each on the back and front of the inside of the case, for inserting a few loose documents. I'd give the binder five stars, except that the case is not very sturdy. As usual it is plastic-covered cardboard. The cardboard is not heavy enough, and my binder arrived with both the front and back of the case crumpled so deeply in shipping that it is unusable."
1759,"These are standard folders like many I have used and reused for years.  They are indeed quite sturdy.  One side is cut down significantly lower than usual at the tab area (rather than the tab extending out more).  This doesn't affect me much, as I've always done very well with the regular size tabs and by writing on the folder cover itself. I don't care for the primary colors, but they do stand out in color coding paper files. These are excellent folders, but unless you have a real need for a larger tab, nothing special."
1759,"This is a cute little block of sticky notes in my favorite size, about 3 x 3 inches. The notes are in bright colors--turquoise, magenta, yellow, and lime green--stacked to form irregularly sized stripes on the edges. If you want easy access to the colors in the middle, say for color coding, you can easily pull the block apart. I love them for flagging documents. The 3 x 3 size is large enough for a short handwritten note, but small enough that if it's just a flag for attention, I'm not wasting paper."
1173,"3M seems to have Avery's dominant position in the printable specialty label sheets business very much in the cross hairs. These feed well through standard printers, stick well to paper folders and are everything this simple product should be. I do, however, wish that 3M had removed the bits of paper between the labels on the label sheet like they do for many of their other printable label products. Note that these are Made in the USA, which matters some to me if not to everyone. The last several packages of Avery products I previously purchased were all Made in China."
1173,"I really like these new 3M labels. They feed perfectly through both my laser and my inkjet printers and are of very high quality. The adhesive sticks like crazy once applied to paper or cardboard, yet they are not hard to get off the sheet. Dimensionally these are the same as the Avery 5163 size and thus are easily used with most software. All that plus Made in the USA. Well done 3M!"
1173,"Although the illustration on the package shows these being used to label plastic storage boxes, I don't think this product would do well in that application. They are basically small Post-It sheets with the adhesive covering almost all of the back instead of just a little strip. They would be fine where you need a somewhat temporary label which can be easily removed later, but don't mark your boxes or containers for long term storage and expect them to be nicely labeled years later. Also, the price seems very high for the relatively small number of labels you get.OK for what it is, but not really a wow! product."
1173,"If you print shipping labels with postage from your computer using services like UPS or PayPal's shipping system, these labels do the trick nicely. They feed perfectly through both my ink jet and laser printers (even though they say they are for ink jets). The labels stick well and have the additional feature of being thick enough to block the view of whatever you put them over. This makes them very good for re-labeling boxes where there is something you need to cover up.Avery paid attention to the details with this well done product. Kudos!"
1173,"I'm the editor for a small newsletter for a local club, so I have used a lot of laser printable mailing labels over the years. These new 3M labels are the best I've tried. They are easy to peel off the backing sheet, yet stick like crazy once applied to paper.  Alignment wise they worked perfectly when I set up Microsoft Word to use the Avery 5160 template. I also like that they say Made in the USA on the package. Not everyone cares about the country of origin, but it is a factor to me."
1173,"I wouldn't recommend these to replace the normal style for everyday use, but sometimes you need a note which is going to both lay flat and stay on better. These add a second strip of adhesive towards the bottom of the paper just like the usual one at the top. This makes them a bit harder to remove from the pad, but also makes them stick much better in use.Most of the time these are overkill, but if you are going to mark things outside on a windy day, or have a slick, hard to adhere to surface to put them on, then these will fill the bill.But, if you like the normal kind just fine and those work for you, stick with 'em :)."
1173,"This is pretty much the Scotch Invisible tape I've known for years, but the dispenser has gotten flimsier over time. Cost reductions, don't ya' know. I still like the Scotch original better than most of the alternative or store brand versions. They often seem close, but not quite right. 3M/Scotch has the formula just right for strength and stickiness. Sometimes the original remains the best. I would have given it five stars were in not for the flimsy dispenser.I agree with the other reviewers who noted that splitting this into three separate mini-rolls is wasteful and counterproductive. I would have much preferred one sturdy dispenser with all of the tape on it instead of three small rolls. Alas, putting less and less product in each container seems to be one of modern marketing's favorite tricks. Remember when coffee was sold by the pound, and ice cream by the half gallon?"
1173,"So many products these days come in every skimpier packaging which makes storage and reuse annoying. These laminating sleeves are the typical 3 mil thick Chinese manufactured ones just like you might find under other brand names. So, choose on price per unit since nothing about this product stands out."
1173,"How much can be said about ""sticky notes""? Obviously 3M's original is the benchmark, and this Avery product seems every bit as good. The adhesive sticks well without harming normal surfaces. The paper is smooth and takes both ink and pencil well. The colors are fun, and each color is part of its own little 50 piece pad. Now you can color code your heart out and get away from all yellow, all the time."
1173,"I've used many mechanical pencils over the years, and I normally need to use a 0.7mm or larger one due to my heavy handedness. However, with this pencil I'm able to use it comfortably without breaking the lead even though it is the finer, 0.5mm size. The auto rotation feature which tends to keep a sharp point on the lead also works very nicely. Move over Pentel, I've got a new favorite!"
1173,"Ever since Eastman introduced ""Eastman 910"", cyanoacrylate adhesives have served a number of purposes in industry, around the shop, and in the home. Scotch's version doesn't seem to have any remarkable qualities compared to others I have used. It is on the thin side of this class of products, and would likely be excellent for delicate jobs such as repairing broken ceramics.The unique feature of Scotch's implementation is the specially shaped applicator which does make it fairly easy to control the dispensing of adhesive. All in all a decent product, but nothing which puts it light years ahead of similar products from Loctite and others."
1173,"These work great for holding lightweight things like postcards and pictures to the wall or fridge without making a mess. Who knows when you might want to take down the pictures you were once so eager to have on display :). I've noticed that most 3M products still seem to be Made in the US, as these are. Whenever possible I try to get US made goods, so that is an upside for me. Whether that matters to others or not is a matter of personal choice."
1173,"We use these for temporary signage at our business, and the bright bold colors are a real advantage for our use. Eraseability is a secondary concern for our needs, we are looking for something that stands out."
1173,"As sticky notes go, these are of good quality. Nice paper, appropriate stickiness and fun colors. But, having all of the different sizes on top of each other in a single pad doesn't actually work very well. We just ended up separating the various sizes into their own little pads and then they work great."
1173,"I've always hated licking envelopes, and I don't do enough of them to make it worth keeping a wet sponge handy. This Reveal-N-Seal method doesn't use a peel-off strip like many of the competitors do. That means less trash and less hassle. Instead of peeling off a disposable strip, you just fold up a little mini-flap to reveal the adhesive and then close the envelope normally.The blue security printing does a good job of hiding the contents from prying eyes, the paper is of good quality and the construction is first rate. I was surprised to find that my box was marked ""Made in Germany"". How it can be cost effective to import office supplies from Germany to the US is a bit of a mystery to me, but so it must be."
1173,"These mini sticky notes are really great for marking pages of catalogs, books and the like. The mix of colors is helpful if you like to do the color coding thing. My only complaint is that once the package is torn open you don't have any good way to contain the things and keep them organized. They are so small that they easily go missing on my desk. Something a little more clever in the packaging area would move this product up to a full five stars for me."
382,No problems printing with a laser printer on these labels.  Avery templates in Word lined up perfectly.  Adhesive is strong.  Price seems comparable to other brands.  These labels will certainly meet your needs.
382,These are designed to work seamlessly with the Avery templates built into Word.  I especially appreciate the fact that the excess material around each lable has been peeled off making them easy to remove without causing any jamming problems when printing.  The ink does not smear and they stick well to emvelopes.  I find them to be perfect in every way.
382,"I like the single touch lever that pops the rings open.  I also like the D-ring style with the rings mounted on the back of the binder rather than the spine.  For me, this always makes the pages turn better once the binder gets really full.  There are two tiers of clear plastic on the inside cover, both front and back to use as pockets as well as the usual slipcover for front, back & spine.  Though the back cover has some grommets from where the rings attach, you can still get a full sheet of paper in the back slipcover.  The only thing odd about this binder is that the ""perforations"" along the fold lines are more pronounced that any other brand I've seen.  My hope is that this won't be a point of weakness over the long haul."
382,"Great vibrant colors will really stand out for color coding purposes.  Made to be removable but they are ""Super Sticky"" so they should stay put until peeled off.  Codes are included for both Avery and Post-it templates.  Labels are easy to peel off the sheet once printed because the extra label material between the columns is already peeled away."
382,I'm sure these will work with whatever printer and software you're used to using for printing shipping labels.  The big advantage here is that the label is designed to paste right over any other label on the box and guarantee a scanner doesn't pick up any barcodes from the label below.  This way you can reuse boxes without having to try and peel off the old lables.  I have no doubt that these will accomplish that.  They are so thick not even Superman could see through them!
382,"These work with the Avery templates built into Word.  They are ""quick lift"" which means there is bare space between the columns that makes it easy to peel off the labels.  They did not jam or smear in my printer.  Adhesion on the envelpoe seems good.  They are not lacking in any way.  I highly recommend."
382,"These tabs work great.  colors are bright, tab is stiff and sufficiently sticky to lead me to believe it will hold up over time.  To make these a 5 star they could have a.  made the surface dry-erase so you could reuse them or change your mind and b. made the bottom of the tab sized for the slots on a hanging file folder so it could do double duty."
382,"Hard to get too excited about a box, but here are my thoughts:Pros-easy to assemble, one piece including lid, refolds flat as single piece for storage until reused, strong.Cons- locking closure is not really that secure.  Tabs fit into the handle hole and when you carry it by the handles, it is closed securely.  The tabs don't go in far enough to convince me they are really going to stay tucked as the box gets moved around on a storage shelf and if used for shipping, tape would definitely be required."
382,"I have a Fellowes laminator at home and got this one to use at work.  The Swingline model is noticeably more &#34;industrial strength&#34;.  It can accommodate a much wider pouch than the Fellowes model I have but the trade off is that it has a much larger footprint.  The Swingline model also offers a reverse mode and will auto-reverse if it detects a jam. Even the cord seems extra long and extra heavy duty. It comes with a sheet of cardboard you are supposed to feed through after each session to clear out any extraneous adhesive left behind.  The control panel is simple to use and gives a little countdown dial of the wait time until it is ready to use.I thought I would really like the feature where it auto detects the pouch thickness but it turns out that setting just makes it choose the longer warm up cycle (5 minutes instead of just 1)in case you happen to feed in a 10 mil pouch.  If you're only using a 3 mil pouch, why wait the extra time?  Still, its a handy feature if you're not sure what kind of pouch you have.All in all it seems like a workhorse that will withstand pretty high volume use.  If you don't have high volume needs, the Fellowes Saturn2 machines would be a less costly choice."
382,"Obviously this product is in competition with Post-Its or store brands like Staples ""Stickies"".  Truthfully, I've not found much difference between any manufacturer of sticky notes.  They all seem to work equally well.  This product sets itself aside by offering Box Tops for Education so if you participate in that program that could tip the scale for you.  Either way, these are another perfectly fabulous product by Avery to help you get your act together!"
382,"These have multiple applications.  You can use them as tabs on dividers in a binder or for stand-out tabs on file folders or hanging files.  This particular size has 2 inches of writing space on the tab itself but a ton more room (3"" x 3"")down on the stick-on portion.  You could put the main idea on the tab itself and more detailed notes on the remainder.  They seem sufficiently stiff and sticky to hold up over time, though I do not really see them as something you could remove and replace without losing some of the adhesion.  The tab is erasable if you use a pencil but pen/marker does not wipe off."
382,"For use as a tab on divider pages or to make folders stand out beyond the built in tab, these work great.  You have about 2.75"" of space to write on the tab.  Pencil erases but pen is permenant.  Enough room on the non-tab portion to provide stability for the adhesive surface and give you extra space to write.  A handy thing to have in your desk drawer to mark those things you want to be able to find in a hurry."
382,"These work with either inkjet or laser printers and are designed to be removable rather than permenant.  This would be a distinct advantage for situations where you want to be able to re-label the item for each subsequent use.  These are ""Super Sticky"" which gives them greater adhesion than a standard Post-it note while still being removable.  They include both Avery Template numbers and Post-it Template numbers.  Labels are not ""quick lift"" but seem easy to peel up."
382,"Smead FasTab (64201) hanging folders are nice heavy duty hanging files with 2"" expansion bottoms.  They have a built in tab for labeling/organizing in 3 set positions.  You can write directly on the tab or stick on a label but if you want to reuse the folder for something else later on, you're going to have to stick another label on top of that to change the name.  It's not like the standard plastic tabs where you can pick the position and re insert fresh tab labels when you want to.These are quick and easy to use but the trade off is less flexibility.  But if you have plans to set up a filing system that won't evolve or change, these would be a great choice."
382,"These lables are compatible with Word using the Avery numbers.  3M also provides a link to free templates if you need.  I especially appreciate that these are ""Quick Lift"" in that the extra label material between columns is already removed which makes it easier to peel each label.  Compare the price.  These are as good as any other brand you may have used in the past."
382,"If you've ever used a Mr Clean magic eraser, you'll recognize this item right out of the box.  They seem virtually identical except the blue side of the 3M eraser that you hold on to is much more substantial than the Mr Clean erasers.  It did a good job of erasing fresh marks on a whiteboard when used dry.  More stubborn marks came off well when water was used.  It should be noted that the pad degrades substantially when water is used so this eraser becomes a ""disposable"" item rather than something that will last the life of your whiteboard.  If cost is an issue for you, you might want to try the Mr Clean eraser and see if it will meet your whiteboard needs since they are about half the price of the 3M."
382,"Well, we all know and love Post-it notes.  This dispenser is intended for the pop-up variety (which without a dispenser are truly annoying).  The device mounts to a solid surface (the glass wall of my cubicle) with a combination Command adhesive/Velcro strip.  You stick two strips on the back of the dispenser, two strips on the wall, let them ""cure"" for an hour and then mount the dispenser.  The Velcro stuff is not your typical Velcro.  It actually ""snaps"" into place and gives a firm hold without any wiggle.  When the pad is used up, you'd simply slide in a repalcement.  To permenantly remove the dispenser, you pull a tab at the end of a strip which releases the adhesive.  I do not think the mounting strips would be reusable so you'd better be sure of your placement when you hang it up.  Also included is a slot for a pen.  These work great for the office where desk space is at a premium and would also be ideal for mounting on the 'fridge door at home.  Nobody will ever run off with your Post-it pad again!"
386,"I have a number of 3M wrist wrests/pads, and I love almost all of them.  Over the years, I have tried just about every type of material out there.Gel is the most comfortable to me, and I've found gels are not always the same softness.  This one is just right.This review is for the 18"" one.  It is on the smaller side for compact spaces or keyboards.  It also works fine on larger, full-size keyboards, though.What I really like about this one is that it is tapered from front to back which matches the angle of keyboards.  It is very comfortable.As mentioned, I have several 3M wrist rests.  This one is leatherette.  It is more comfortable than I would have thought.  My other ones are the fabric covered ones.  This one, therefore, may cause more sweat/grunge build-up, but it is vastly easier to clean than the fabric ones.  I feel that the gel in the 3M antimicrobial FABRIC covered wrist rests is a bit too firm, while the non-antimicrobial FABRIC one is more like this one (my preference).One final comment is that 3M puts a very good ""sticky"" plastic on the bottom.  The wrist rest does not slide around a bit.  The plastic is like the vinyl press-apply decals.  It does a great job.  Never marred any surface I've used them on such as wood, Formica, etc.Just an excellent wrist pad!"
386,"I have been using these in various applications, and I honestly cannot find any noticeable difference between these and the ""original"" 3M Post-It notes.  The stick on various surfaces is about the same as is the lack of any residue when leaving after several days or when exposed to moderate heat.  They write on fine as well.I also cannot find that these are better in any way either, so I would choose whichever is cheaper.  Currently, the Avery ones are cheaper, but if you shop around or buy larger packs, you can find significantly better deals.  Or choose whichever one has the better colors that you may like, etc."
386,"I gave some other 3M labels not-so-stellar reviews, but these return address labels are great.  On the larger labels, the not-so-sticky ""permanent adhesive"" was not so impressive, but for tiny return address labels on envelopes, it is fine.  Also, the thin paper on the larger shipping labels lets the labels/writing underneath show through.  This is not an issue on the return address labels.  All the labels seem to use the same adhesive and paper, and it just seems to be designed for small return address labels and doesn't ""extend"" to the larger ones very well.  The Quick Lift is really a neat feature as well to remove the labels from the backing paper.  I have a customer picture on the 1"" x 2.6"" labels (3100-A) page if you are really interested.  I also had no problems using the recommended Avery template."
386,"I like these.  They are colorful, and it's convenient to have a stack of assorted colors in one convenient pad.  The colors are bright and the sticky part is about as good as 3M Post-it notes or perhaps a little weaker.  5 stars at this point.I'm not super-keen on each color being a different size.  Each color down the pad is about 1cm longer than the one on top.  That sort of means you can't 100% choose your color, but then again, you have a few sizes to choose from as well.  As each sub-pad gets used up, it's a little more awkward to write on.  Still 5 stars.What I don't like so much is that the pages are perforated.  Thus, you have to be careful in separating a sheet off the pad.  This leaves a somewhat ratty edge, but I don't like to have to concentrate or pay attention to such a simple detail.  I just want to whip a sheet off the pad and stick the note somewhere.  This costs it a star.  What I found you can do, however, is crease the whole top pad up and out of the way and the top perforated part will remove along with the sheet giving you a double-wide strip of sticky at the top of the sheet, albeit with a perforation in the middle.  This makes up for the perforation, so I'm back to giving it 5 stars."
386,"These are nice in that they are nicely die-cut with margins to peel them off the backing sheet with rounded edges that reduce getting caught or lifting.  What I found unimpressive, however, is that the labels are rather thin.  If you are placing the label over other writing or a previous label, some of it will show through.  You can even see the 3M logo through the label which is on the back side of the backing sheet.  I've used other labels which are thicker/more opaque and do a better job at this.  Also, I expected ""Permanent"" to be more permanent.  If you're sticking the label to something like a bubble mailer, the thinness will help, but the adhesive is actually not that sticky.  You can peel them off if you need to.  I would say the adhesive is just Standard adhesive."
386,"These are really nice in that you can feed them through your laser printer.  The corners are rounded, and they come out really nice.  I like these a lot better than the ones that come in a pad with a tear-off strip.  The price is also better.My only gripe is that 3M calls these Super Sticky.  The entire label is sticky, but only slightly more so than regular Post-it notes.  I would call them ""More Sticky"".  IMO, they really are only adequately sticky on smooth, clean surfaces.The bright assortment is nice."
386,"I did not expect much, so these impressed me.  They are a bit on the thin/flimsy side, but the seal is a gem and works very well.  There is no extra tape/strip that you have to dispose of.  You lift up a flap to expose the adhesive which is protected by a shiny plastic coating on the underside of the flap.  It is actually patented, if you can believe that.I have long given up licking envelopes and usually head for a sink or drinking fountain.  These are so convenient in that regard.  The security printing is also nice.  I would give them 5 stars, but the price is a bit of a deterrent."
386,"Compared to regular Post-it notes, the entire backing of these labels is adhesive.  To remove them from the pad, there is then a non-sticky, tear-off portion.  The tear-off portion doesn't tear-off that easily and leaves a somewhat torn edge which is not as clean as with regular pads.  You almost have to pinch it and tear it to get it started.The whole point of these labels with full adhesive coverage is then to stick to things like storage containers, etc.  These containers sometimes have weird slippery plastic film on them or are not that smooth, so regular Post-it notes do not stick so well.  These are better, but I would not go so far as to call them super sticky.  They are adequate, especially on clean surfaces, but not ""Super"".  Super would borderline on being difficult to remove (which would be a good thing).  They are definitely removable which means they could still come off during normal handling, but yes, they are more sticky than regular Post-it notes.Finally, these are rather pricey for such a tiny package.See my customer image for the tear strip part."
386,"I am a big Post-it fan.  While I like the general concept of this, the dispenser kind of wrecks it.First, a minor pet peeve is that the tape roll is taped down with Magic tape.  To get that tape off which is recessed down in the dispenser is a lesson in frustrationful packaging and ultimately wastes about 8-10"" of the roll.Next, the ""cutter"" just doesn't cut clean.  It cuts ratty, or not all the way, or crooked.  Assuming you are more of a neat-freak to begin with and that is why you are organizing and labeling things in the first place, this doesn't ""cut it"".Next, there is no way to measure out equal strips.  Not a deal-breaker though.Finally, you can't write on it while it is in the dispenser through a small slot/opening -- maybe an inch and a half worth.  So, you must first ""apply"" it to something like a clean table, then remove it and place it on your item.  Because the sticky goo is just so-so, you lose stick applying and reapplying your label.On the plus side, however, it is a thin tape strip which conforms better to things like bottles, jars, canisters, etc.  Another product to consider is the full-adhesive Post-it notes (which are full adhesive and not just a strip at the top), but I found those only really work on flat things.  On any sort of curve, ultimately, the flatness of the Post-it note wins and it lifts off/falls off.This Post-it tape works better in that regard on curved surfaces and therefore warrants a 3 star rating from me."
386,"For better or worse, these are basically the same as the Post-it brand of page markers.  They are paper and not to be confused with the Post-it brand page flags which are plastic (and about 2-3X more expensive).These page markers, made out of 1/2"" slices of Post-it like paper, come in 5 pads of 50 markers each in 5 colors.  Because they are rather narrow/thin, they are better suited to short-term temporary use.  If you use them for any longer, then they will likely catch on something and tear.  If you want to write on them (for example to mark a passage in a text book), you might consider instead the Post-it brand because they come in wider versions such as 7/8"" and 1"" which you can write more or write larger and due to the larger size, they last a little bit longer.These, however, are good if you don't want to write on them -- just want to mark a few pages such as in a magazine or something that you will file away on a shelf and not get banged around in a backpack, etc.  In this case, these are a more economical alternative to the Post-it branded version."
386,"Compatibility with Avery 5160 template was a snap!  They also share some of the basic attributes that I have found with other 3M labels.  That is, the paper is thin and not opaque enough for me, and the adhesive is not as permanent as I would like.On the other hand, these labels are nicely die-cut and super easy to remove.  These have a feature that I have not seen in other labels.  At the tops and bottoms of the pages, there are cuts about 1/8"" along the center two gaps between the labels.  These small cuts lead to perforations down the page.  This makes it easy to tear the page into 3 pieces, and the tear is approximately 1/8"" UNDER the label.  This leaves 1/8"" of the label extending past the perforated edge, so you can easily grab them off the backing sheet.  A really neat idea.  See my customer picture if my text description is working for you."
584,"No one likes to move, and one of the pains of doing so is finding boxes in order to packing your stuff.  Every time we have moved or helped someone else move, it seems they always come up short on boxes or more often short on packing tape.  Seems like one person always manages to cut themselves on the packing tape dispenser, too.Fellowes came up with a fantastic design on their SmoothMove boxes, making packing tape completely unnecessary.  These boxes are easy to make, extremely sturdy, and reusable many times over.  We have already used them twice for moving friends and family and everyone liked them.  Most boxes you get do not have handles, but this feature makes these even more desirable because they are easier to carry.  The boxes also have preprinted sections for writing what room they go in and what the contents are.  While this can impact the ability to reuse them, we have always used a numbering system instead of a naming system.  For instance, the living room is #1 and the master bedroom is #2, and so forth.  We usually write the detailed location of where the contents belong on the contents section, such as ""kitchen pantry"" or ""jack's dresser"".  The boxes are a little pricey, but the convenience, reliability and usability make them a very worthwhile investment.  Other sizes are also available depending on your needs."
584,"I like this leatherette gel wrist rest more than the cloth covered kind.  The material used on others is icky to me, kind of gives me the same feeling as when somone runs their fingernails down a chalkboard.  I have never thought much about the necessity of having an anti-microbial wrist rest, I think I would tend to me more cautious of the mouse itself.Product is well made and appears it will last quite a while and is easy to clean with a quick wipe.  I like the fact that it is a standalone wrist rest, too, as it it easier to just throw in my bag and use with my travel mouse.  All in all, I think it is quite handy and useful."
584,"While I think the price of tape has gotten out of hand over the past few years, I still stick with the brand I have grown to know and love so well - Scotch Magic!  I have always preferred tape that becomes virtually invisible when applied and does not leave a horrible residue if/when removed.  I have never had a problem with it and rely on it for any situation where I need a little bit of tape."
584,"The first thought which ran through my mind when I was offered the opportunity to try these labels was, ""How can a label be super sticky and removable at the same time?"".  Because I tend to reuse manila folders multiple times, this really appealed to me as long as it really worked.  When trying to remove other labels, I have always had a few layers of the folder removed or sometimes torn completely.  However, I am happy to find these labels live up to their name.  Not only did they adhere well to the manila folders, I was able to remove them a number of times both immediately after applying (trying to get them on straight) and a few weeks later (as a test).Although these labels cost a bit more than competitor's products, the removability feature means I am spending less on folders.  I tested these labels on a laser printer with no problems.  Many people do not realize or know that some laser printers have a switch on them (uually in the back) to feed labels or thicker media straight through.  Having labels run through the drum makes them curl and the likelihood of a label coming off and becoming stuck is high.  This can result in a costly repair bill to have removed or fixed.Additionally, label sheets are not meant to be ran through laser printers more than once.  The heat affects the adhesive, so be sure you are ready to print a full sheet or be prepared to waste some labels.  If you try to run them through more than once, this will also increase the chances of them becoming stuck."
584,"Who likes having holes in their walls or paint damage?  I know I don't, so I was eager to try these tabs out to see if they worked as advertised. We have always used putty but found it sometimes leaves a discolored mark on the wall which is almost as bad as paint damage.  These tabs are exceptionally sticky, and even though it seems like they could peel paint, it hasn't happened yet.  You can cut/trim the tabs somewhat to meet your needs.  They are reusable and when they lose their stickiness due to dust, etc., you can revitalize them by washing, but I'm not sure I will always take the time to do that.For heavier or more permanent items, such as a heavy frame - they tend to get unlevel as time passes.  As mentioned above, we would take some of the putty type products and put one on the bottom middle to hold it steady.  Now these do the same thing without the worry of stains.Definitely not the best option for use with paper.  Just like anything sticky, it is going to adhere to paper more permanently although you can wash the paper off and reuse the tab.  So far, I have not had any trouble with anything falling or these tabs not working as expected, even with our orange peel texture on the walls."
584,"I use a lot of labels both at home and at work, and have always favored Avery labels if for no reason other than those were the first ones I tried and they worked well.  These labels are great, had no problems in my laser printer but they are definitely permanent.  Of course, you can use them for things other than return addresses, but be aware of how sticky and permanent they really are.  I do like the quick lift feature, as it makes it so much easier to remove individual labels since there is no border to come off with the label itself.  If you are looking for quality labels, you simply will not be disappointed."
584,"I had my doubts about these tabs and how useful or practical they would be, especially considering there are only 20 in a package.  I have been surprised at how much I do like them.  The round shape keeps them from getting hung or caught on other items, and they are very thick and sturdy.  They stick well and are reusable but not difficult to remove.  I have tended to use them more as a bookmark more than anything else.Recently, I came across some file folder tabs that are erasable and immediately thought how nice it would be to combine that feature with these tabs.  If so, I could use them as tabs in a binder for manuals, etc. When the binder is updated, I could adjust the tabs and change the names without having to purchase new tabs."
584,"I am typically an Avery product user, but was offered the opportunity to try out some products from 3M recently and decided to give them a go since it was coming up on the time of the year when a lot of filing takes place.  These were tested with a laser printer only and no problems were encountered.  I avoid inkjet printers on most things, as the ink smudges easily and the cost is too high, but that is a different review. ha!I will agree wholeheartedly with the description on these labels, as they are certainly permanent.  This is usually a good thing, but you want to be sure you have them right where you want them before putting them on the folder.  I tend to try to reuse folders and frequently flip manila folders around when doing so; however, I have tried to apply new labels over existing ones in the past but most of the time the labels are too thin to block the previous one sufficiently.  These labels were no exception to this issue, but they did a fairly decent job of covering for the most part.Most of the time, I use a hand-held labeler for manila folders and that allows me to print a label with a custom width based on the text size.  However, the 3M labels are nearly 3.5 inches wide which is well beyond most of my needs, so I feel like much of what I would be paying for is wasted.  I figured the price per label to be approximately 0.017 cents each.  There are likely people who need wider labels, and these would do the trick.  In relation to comparing these to Avery products, I feel the 3M brand is on par with what I would expect."
584,"I hate licking envelopes and prefer using security ones to protect confidential information from prying eyes, so I thought I would really like these.  However, the security markings are poorly done and information is easily read when holding the envelopes up to a light.  The tamper portion works as expected for the most part, but what good does it really do if the contents can be read without doing anything to the envelope itself?  For the price and quantity you receive in combination with these issues, the envelopes are not worth it.  A minor complaint but frustrating nonetheless - the seal on the box itself was so overdone that I had to tear the box open, so I could not use it to store the envelopes any longer."
584,"I have learned the hard way over the years not to skimp on binders.  Cheap ones simply do not last long enough and you wind up spending as much or more on frequent purchases.  I really like the binder portion being on the back of the product, so you are able to get more papers in it and the paper doesn't bow up as much when it is not full.  Having 4 pockets instead of 2 is also a nice add-on, along with the plastic covering that allows you to easily change the cover and edge with the actual contents.  I did knock 1 star off the review because the triangular part that is typically included with binders larger than 1"" in size is not included.  This is typically used to keep the first page from sticking to and/or peeling off onto the binder itself.  Lastly, although this is not a comment concerning the quality and value of the product, I was surprised when I opened the box.  The binder I received appeared to have been exposed to a very dusty and dirty environment and was quite filthy. Whomever put the product in the box should have been aware of this and not sent the product in this shape.  While I was able to clean it up without any permanent damage, it was still surprising to receive a product in this condition."
584,"I have always used Avery 5160's for all my address label needs for the past 15 years but really liked these labels.  I tend to not change things when there is nothing wrong with what I am current using, but one feature of the Avery labels that slightly annoyed me was the leftover label parts between the labels.  Sometimes when removing a label, the cut would not be clean and this part would start coming off, too. 3M has removed that and left a space between the columns, making it easier to remove and use the labels.  Since the 5160 template is compatible with the 3100-A's, it makes sense to change to the 3M brand."
1567,"I've been using these tabs to create dividers in my textbooks and cookbooks.They are great and very useful when the pages of your books are not highlight or notetaking friendly.They come off easily in my most delicate textbooks without damaging the pages, so you can sell your book back at the end of the semester without a problem.Nice colors, great size, very useful.The price could be lower, however."
1567,"The scotch magic tape is the same as always.  It attaches paper to paper with no problem.  I would not use it for anything else.  I tried attaching paper to wood, and the tape fell off.The matte finish is hardly ""invisible"" - I would simply call it clear.  Even attaching paper to paper, you should rub down the tape to make it stick (and make it more clear than matte).Personally I think Scotch's non matte tape is more ""invisible"" and more ""sticky"", so I would buy that instead.  Under no circumstances would I ever buy a non-Scotch brand tape.  Scotch is the best brand out there, I give this product four stars because I think it less tacky than the non-matte tape (in the red packaging)."
1567,"This tape dispense has a nice, streamlined design, but it's still not quite perfect.  The tape still sticks where it shouldn't, and I don't really see how simply rounding the edges constitutes a giant leap forward.  But then, I suppose Scotch is not saying this product is a leap forward, they are merely stating that it has a nice grip.  Which it does.  But it looks like it should be better than the average packing tape dispenser, and it's not as good as it looks like it ought to be (if that makes sense).  Four stars for not meeting expectations on ease of use."
1567,"For some reason when I got this I thought dot roller meant it would literally roll out dots onto a page.  Silly of me, but there you have it.  That's not what this product is -- do you have the white out that comes in this type of roller?  You drag it across a page, make a white highlight, and wipe out your errors?  This works like that, but you get a strip of adhesive -- glue.The glue is not too strong, but perfect for sticking little pieces of paper together.  If you like scrapbooking, this product will probably be a godsend.  I can't imagine what else you would do it it, though, aside from that.  This product is very cool, but doesn't seem very useful.  Or at least I can't think up what to use it for aside from scrapbooking."
1567,"This is a product that does what it says it'll do.I haven't put them in my computer because I don't need a whole sheet of file folder labels, I doubt many people do.I basically hand write the labels and put them on folders to take to class with me.  Rather than dumping the folder at the end of the semester, I just change the label.These labels do a good job.  They don't stand up to a daily beating all that well (into the backpack, out of the backpack.  Repeat.)But they are okay.  I would recommend them, but not super highly.Four stars, because I didn't go with the product's intended use."
1567,"I received these labels in December in Chicago.  The post office left them by the front door, and the blizzard buried the box.  I received a box soaked through and through, with a destroyed label package.  I was concerned about writing this review, as it is difficult to review a paper product spoiled in water.But I dried out the labels, and checked them out.The labels are slightly warped, but remain white in color.  They do not look obviously ruined or bad.  Occasionally they jam up the printer because of the slight warp.  But they work.3M is a good company, with good products.  I am giving this product five stars because it still works and looks good even though the labels were soaked in snow and kind of warped.The adhesive is still good, does not fall off, sticks solidly and well.  The white color was not messed up.  The ink does not run.  All good thinks, especially impressive for still working after being wet.Excellent product, highly recommended."
1567,"I've been using these tabs to create dividers in my textbooks.They are great and very useful when the pages of your books are not highlight or notetaking friendly.They come off easily in my most delicate textbooks without damaging the pages, so you can sell your book back at the end of the semester without a problem.Nice colors, great size, very useful.The price could be lower, however.For the same price, you can use el cheapo post it notes.  Same utility, less expense.This is clearly a better product, but $5 for 20 post its seems obscene to me.If you can afford it, this product is perfect for creating dividers (like in those three ring binders) without a three ring binder."
1567,"I love these labels!They look just like post its, but are more ""sticky"" and are ""sticky"" all over.I stick them on files, boxes, calendar, planner, just about anywhere that I want a more ""permanent"" post it.The size is very convenient and the colors low key.They are too big for a filing system, but very useful nonetheless.I like the tearaway tab on the end, for the option of making your post it more permanent."
1567,"This is a really terrific product.  Scotch tape that you can always find when you need it (it's right on your desk) that you don't need to unstick or toy with to find the end when you inevitably lose it.  Like many modern day innovative products, it's very helpful to have.  However.  Yes, there is a downside.  It's really expensive.  The dispenser itself is almost $5, and the refills are almost $3 a pop.  The plain old scotch tape dispenser was helpful and not as expensive, even if it occasionally got stuck or lost.  For the price of the dispense and the refills, you could just buy more scotch tape and be just as well off!  Honestly?  This product is great, but I'm not sure if it's really worth the price.  If you have money to burn in these recessionary times and would like to spend it on ""improved"" scotch tape, well, good for you.  Personally, if I had money to burn, scotch tape is not really the first place I'd try to spend it.  But that's just me.  So I give this product high marks, but suggest that you don't really bother buying it.  Sorry, 3M."
1567,"This product works on plastic bins, better than Avery's removable labels do.I would recommend this product over those.I didn't try to use this product in a computer, so I can't comment on that.Still, it could be more sticky and reusable.  But they work better than a post it note.  So it's a good product."
1567,"I like temporary labels for my storage bins, be they the plastic rubbermaid shoe boxes or the tupperware jars for the different types of flour I use to bake with in my kitchen.These labels stay on and look good! They don't peel off like Avery's labels do.  (I have the Avery labels and gave them five stars, now that they are peeling off my plastic boxes, I'd like two of those stars back!)I would highly recommend this product."
1567,"Address labels.Permanent.White.Nice, neat, do the job.What more do you want?(I haven't tried printing them out with my computer yet - it seems like too much trouble.  I generally just hand write the label for the 9x12 manilla envelope when applying for jobs.  This way it looks neat without taking too much effort.)"
587,"The adhesive on this is similar to post it notes. The adhesive covers the entire back of the label except for a small tear-off portion on the side which makes pulling each piece off the pad easy.I love that there are three different colors on each pad.I have a Brother P-touch label printer and I will definitely be using these as a quicker alternative.My only reservation is that I am not sure how long the adhesive will hold. If you put it on a piece of paper, file folder, etc and bend it, the label's corner starts to lift off."
587,"I've been using Avery labels for years and will occasionally by store brand labels if there is a good deal. While similar I think the Avery labels are generally of slightly better quality. I was curious where 3M would fall on the quality scale.I'm very impressed!I set up various label sheets in MS Word (using the compatible Avery 5163 template).  I had no issues whatsoever printing within the margins.  The labels feed smoothly into the printers I used.  The print quality was excellent.  Although suggested for Lasers, I tried them in my color ink jet and had great results as well.  I also fed the same sheet through the printers several times (not recommended by 3M) and the labels still came out beautifully with no jamming.The adhesive is very strong. I tried it on several envelopes and cardboard boxes. Once attached they did not peel off easily.  When I finally managed to work up a corner the came off in one big piece but I have no worries that they will fall off in the mail or pop off over time.If you're a loyal Avery consumer, don't be scared. These labels are fantastic."
587,"If you like the convenience of the hand held pop up tape dispensers, chances are you'll like this.It does not pull up off the desk as I expected. It's amazingly sturdy in that sense.  It does slide very easily however so you have to have it anchored behind something (keyboard, etc) unless you pull directly straight up."
587,"Now we can make custom raffle tickets for our non-profit events. We used to use the standard admission style tickets but there was little room on the back for information. Now we can customize the part that the customer fills in (name and phone only, email etc). We can also provide information (marketing if you will) on the ticket stub.No issues with printing.Tear off is easy.Can't recommend these enough."
587,"I love the circular tape dispensers. It's great that they are so lightweight and yet don't lift off your work surface when you pull the tape out.The hand held dispensers are great when you need a hand.I love having a multi pack so I can throw a dispenser in each room of the house.Now for the downsides:The circular dispenser only sticks to flat surfaces so trying to use it on a kitchen table with a tablecloth is a joke. (Probably not really it's intended use, but something to keep in mind).The refills don't hold many pieces of tape so doing large projects (say wrapping a ton of presents) gets tiresome having to replace the refills, not to mention how expensive it can be.Finally when it comes to wrapping or doing projects where you need a lot of pieces in a row, each piece of tape comes out in the opposite direction of the piece before it so you have to constantly turn your hand around to pull it out or the tape comes out upside down.I've used both of these products before and was very happy with them for quick uses but found them both annoying for anything requiring a lot of tape."
587,"Although listed as laser printers, I found the labels worked just as well on my ink jet printer as my laser printer.I fed sheets through the printers multiple times (manufacturer advises against this) and there was no jamming or warping of the sheets.I had no issue setting up my labels in MS Word using the Avery 5160 template.I was skeptical of the ""super sticky removable"" adhesive.  If they were removable, would I be able to use them as address labels?  If the adhesive was that secure, would I really be able to remove them without tearing them?  Believe it or not, the answer is yes to both.  Once affixed, the labels stay firmly in place.  I tried bending the envelopes they were on at the corner to see if they would start to peel off but they didn't.  You need to lift a corner with your fingernail and then they peel off.  I was very impressed."
587,"Love these labels!Rather than printing on paper and affixing it with tape, you can do it all in one step with these labels.  The Tru-Block technology works as described. You can put this label over an old one and nothing at all shows through.The labels dont smear or smudge and I haven't had one jam in the printer yet.I took off one star because I wish the adhesive was a little stronger.  I am sure they will last through delivery but I find myself rubbing my finger over the edges a bit because the adhesive isn't as strong as some other labels I've used.Overall they are terrific and I don't mind shipping my ebay items anymore!"
587,"These tabs are nice and sturdy. The adhesive is similar to post-its - strong but removable. The tabs are repositionable so you can reuse them (or reapply them if you put them on crooked).Each tab comes attached to 3 transparent squares that also have the repositionable adhesive on the back.  You can put these on sheets to make notes or highlight without marking up the actual pages. I'm not sure how often I'll be using these. I would prefer to have more tabs and fewer transparent squares.It's a little more difficult than I expected to tear the tabs/dividers apart.  It's not terribly hard, but you need two hands to do it.I have tried these on several different books and paper and have not had any issues with ink being pulled off the page after removing the tabs.I usually use post its to flag pages or divide sections of books. This is defintely a more durable option - especially if you will be using the tabs frequently. You can pull the tabs to open to the page you need instead of having to run your finger in front of the tab and open it manually."
587,"I love these labels.  How many times have you ""opened a file"" on something only to find it wasn't needed or you already had one? With these you can easily remove the label and fasten a new one with a different file name.  I usually handwrite my labels and when I can reuse a folder I turn it inside out and put a new label on the outside. Now I can just remove the label and put a new one on it.  There's nothing to cross off or peel off on the back.My only gripe is that the labels are a lot thinner (more see through) than traditional labels and I don't really understand why. I have tried many 3M/Post-It labels and these are considerably thinner.  The are still good quality but I was disappointed that I can't place them over the folders I already have because the handwriting or old labels show through.Overall a great bet though. I highly recommend them.  No issues with printing whatsoever."
587,"I'm a little surprised by all of the positive reviews here to be honest.The tabs are much thicker than I anticipated. I started thinking they'd be able to hold heavier sheets of paper (thick construction paper, artwork with glued on things, etc.)  No such luck.  My first attempted hanging resulted in the paper falling to the ground within an hour or two. Maybe it was the texture of the paper.I've since successfully hung a few single sheets of copy paper on the back of my office door.  I've tried to reposition them but the paper starts to tear and it threatens to peel the paint off the door.I think I'll take my chances with a piece of much less expensive tape.  This seems too sticky for regular paper and not sticky enough for anything of substance."
587,"Wow. These were much smaller than I anticipated.  Yes, I realize they are return shipping labels which I have used many times in the past, but they are still smaller than I expected.Three lines of a 9 pt. font barely fit on a label. There are 80 labels per sheet.Since they are small I also ran into some issues using the compatible Avery template in MS Word.  Since there is such a small margin if your paper is not PERFECTLY aligned, some labels are cut off.As far as label quality goes, they are fantastic.  Although the manufacturer only recommends feeding them through a laser printer once, I fed them multiple times throuugh both laser and ink jet printers and never had an issue.I have used several 3M label products and the quality is great. The adhesive is strong and I have yet to have a sheet jam in the printer even with all of the testing I do with them."
587,I have to say I was a little skeptical about this product. I couldn't imagine it would be easy to tear out a middle sheet without tearing the paper or ripping apart the pad.I was wrong.This pad is wonderful.  There is a thick and sturdy binding around the pad that keeps the different pads together.  You can easily grab the color or size that you need and pull it out without ripping the paper or disturbing the entire pad.I usually have two or three post-it pads on my desk because I like the small ones and the big ones. This is a great solution. I will definitely be buying another when this pad runs out.
587,"I was excited to try these envelopes out.  I have been using peel and seal envelopes for a few years now and have tried several different types.  Unfortunately this doesn't seem to be the best out there and the price isn't low enough to overlook its flaws.The adhesive strip is very VERY narrow.  While it may be strong it certainly doesn't give me the confidence in it as some of its competitors that have an inch or so strip of adhesive.The flap that you pull up to expose the adhesive is also very narrow.  I keep finding that when I fold it up and run my finger over it to keep it up I end up running my finger against the already questionable adhesive.The security tint is sufficient.  The paper stock is good.  It is a decent envelope. I just prefer the types with a removable strip to expose the adhesive, or one that has a much wider flap and adhesive."
587,"The convenience of pop-up post-it notes wherever you want them! I've always liked the pop up type of post-its and this makes it even more convenient because it doesn't have to be sitting on a flat surface (desk, table, etc.).  The mounting tapes are very strong and easy enough to remove. This is perfect for mounting by the phone, on the fridge or on a wall next to your desk. The fact that it holds a pen makes it even better. I'll probably pick up a few more for other areas of the house and office.Great product!"
587,"The pop up tape dispenser is such a simple thing yet it's amazing at the same time.The rubber band that wraps around your hand is comfortable. It's not too tight and stretchy enough that it would fit a wide range of hand sizes.The tape pops up on alternate sides (similar to how pop up post-its come out of that dispenser).I haven't had any issues with it jamming or with too many pieces coming out at once. One piece of precut tape is always ready.  You slide one side to open the dispenser and the pad of tape slides right in.It is perfect for projects using a lot of tape (craft projects, wrapping presents, etc) especially when you need two hands.My only concerns are availability and price of refills. It would be well worth the price to pay for refills around Christmas time but I'm not sure I would pay that much for day to day use when I can use inexpensive rolls of tape."
824,"I recently testedScotch Magic(TM) Tape 3105, 3/4-inch x 300 Inches, 3-Packagainst Scotch's(R) Satin Finish Gift-wrap tape.  Both were both 3/4 inches wide.You can't go wrong with either of these products!  They both came in the very familiar and proven dispensers - nothing fancy, and they just work well.I was surprised to see that the Matte Finish product was actually more invisible than the Satin Finish Gift-wrap product - but unless you saw them side by side, you'd never know.The Satin Finish Gift Wrap Tape did allow me to easily remove or reposition the tape.  Either way, find the best price, keep it simple, and use either of these tape products - you will not be disappointed!"
824,"I ordered aAvery Removable Label Pad, 1 x 3 Inches, Assorted Borders, 120 Labels (22014)and also some aAvery Removable Label Pad, 1 x 3 Inches, Assorted, Solid Neon Colors, 120 Labels (22011).  These are basically the same, other than one set is solid (blue, yellow, green) and the other's colors are just borders.  I like the bordered ones better, as writing inside on the while label stands out better when I place these on file folders.  I like the solid ones for marking other documents, and while they can be used on file folders, so far I've not used them for that reason.Both have a tab on one end, that is not sticky.  These tabs make it easy to peel the label off the pad, or to remove the label.  These are removable!  After I removed them a few times (2 or 3) they still sick petty good.  I'd say these stick better than those other ""popular brand sticky pad sheets"" especially when it comes to re-sticking them.  The tab can be torn off pretty nicely, if you don't want them on the labels.These could not easily be printed on using a computer printer, or a typewriter, as they are sticky.  So, hand-writing is the way to go with these."
824,"I've been a die-hard Avery Label user for years, but when I had a chance to use some from 3M, they work as good or better than Avery.  I'm using these in two HP Laser printers (one black and white, one color) and they work fine (they say they are for laser printers).  The heat from the fuser in the laser printer makes the pages curl just a bit (the printer's issue, not the labels) but they still peal apart just fine, and still well to paper surfaces (envelopes, cardboard).  I also tested a sheet in my color inkjet photo printer, and again - they worked just fine through that printer.Since most of us use an Avery add-in tool to print labels (i.e, with WORD), the 3M labels clearly indicate which Avery template to use.  These 2 x 4 inch 3M labels use the Avery 5163 Template."
824,"This looks like a good idea, thePost-it(R) Pop-up Laptop Notes Dispenser, 3 x 3 Inch (LND-330-3PK), but it's not what I thought it was going to be.  Post-its are great!  This is a smaller package of Post-its that are fanned, every other way in the pad.  I really like Post-its, and I am loyal to the original 3M brand (the other generics that are out there don't stick as well as the original ones do).  But the holder is just a very light weight cardboard, or a heavy weight paper that the Post-it pad is inserted into.  The holder has tape on the back, remove the protective film that covers the tape, and stick the holder anywhere.  It will hold there, and can easily be removed and re-stuck elsewhere, at least a few times before the stick-em no long holds well.So, why only 2 stars?  It's the holder!  It's just a light weight piece of paper that is folded to hold the pad.  I expected something a little more substantial in weight or design.  You know you are paying a premium for that holder, on top of the price of the pad of Post-its.  But the premium is not worth it.  Sure, the holders are colorful, might look nice in the ad, but come-on, it's just a piece of paper folded to hold Post-its.  I would have rather they used a plastic type of holder, even light-weight plastic, then I would have felt the premium that you pay for this would have been worth it."
824,"I usually use Avery labels, but these 3M 1 x 2 5/8ths inch labels are just as good.  They say they are for laser printers, and I've used them in both a black and white laser printer, and in a color laser printer, and they print fine, and peal off fine, and stick fine.  I've also tested them in an inkjet photo printer, and they worked fine in that too.  If you use an Avery Template Add-in to print labels (such as with WORD) then select Avery Template 5160 for these, and you'll be all set!My advise, find the best price on either the 3M or Avery version of these, and go with the brand that costs you less - as both work equally well."
824,"You can't go wrong with these flags; bright, removable, holds tight enough, but removes easy too.  Writable (with ink or pencil).  I feel safe putting these on light-weight paper, or regular paper, without any concern that they will mark the paper of tear it if I need to remove them.When you take these out of their bubble packaging, they are stuck to a plastic card, and you remove each one as needed from that clear card.  A dispenser of some sort would be nice, but this card with these stuck on them is just a little smaller than the size of a credit card, so this does not take up a lot of space, and is convenient for easy access and storage."
824,"I recently tested Scotch's(R) Matte Finish against Scotch's(R) Satin Finish Gift-wrap tape (Scotch Gift Wrap Tape, 3/4 inch, 3 rolls).  Both were 3/4 inches wide.You can't go wrong with either of these products!  They both came in the very familiar and proven dispensers - nothing fancy, and they just work well.I was surprised to see that the Matte Finish product was actually more invisible than the Satin Finish Gift-wrap product - but unless you saw them side by side, you'd never know.The Satin Finish Gift Wrap Tape did allow me to easily remove or reposition the tape.  Either way, find the best price, keep it simple, and use either of these tape products - you will not be disappointed!"
824,"I was given these index tabs (3x3 inch + 1/2 in tab), and wondered how I would use them.They are made out of a nice plastic, strong, these will not tear (you'd really have to work hard to do that). They come in colors, I have green, white, and the tab part has a paper layer on top of the plastic so you can ""write"" on the tab.  These work great on papers or folders where you want a tab added, but I was hoping for a way to print on them with my computer printer, and that's not possible.  That would have made these even better, giving a more professional look (Avery, take note and sell these on a sheet to be fed into a printer). If you or your office still have a typewriter, I think these could be typed on (though I have not tried that).  However, just writing nice on them works too!These stick to your pages, using a sticky material that is much better than those yellow-note-pads that we all use that are removable (I can't use the product name here), yet these still are removable with a little work, and NO they don't leave any sticky residue if you do remove them!  Pretty cool!  Don't worry about them falling off, the 3 inch x 3 inch sticky part really does a a good job hold them in place.For the right person and for the right need, these will work great, but for an overall professional office product for final presentations, there are better options.  I would not stock these in my office supply cabinet at work, but I would make them something people could order for the right need."
824,"At first I thought, ""Post-it's for file folder labels, not a good idea, I can't have those falling off.""But these are fine, and do stick well.  I've only had them for a month or so, and maybe over time in a filing cabinet they will dryout or lose their stickiness, but so far, they are easy to work with, and adhear nicely, and I'd recommend them if you want a removable label."
824,"I have the set of 8, and they are really unique - in that they are retractable sharpies!  Yes, click the top and the sharpie and the tip comes out.  Why don't they dry out?  Because when you click them again, they retract back in and as they do, a little door in the tip closes to keep them from drying out.  Now, I've only had these a few days, and they work great, but I have to wonder how well that little door mechanism will seal over time?  For now, they are really nice, and maybe the engineering of the door seal will exceed my expectations!  The tips are not round, but shaped so you can make a thick or thin line depending on how you hold the marker.  The plastic case holds each pen in a slot, so they don't float around in the case - nice feature.  The case has a flap that closes to hold them in place too.UPDATE: I've used these for a while to write on paper, and recently I tried to use them to mark/label some DVDs.  Other Sharpies that I've used have been a good solution for writing on the tops of CDs and DVDs.  However, when I tried to use these new retractable Sharpies, the ink beads up, and does not cover nicely.  I was disappointed.So, I read the printing on the markers closer, and they say: ""Sharpie Accent Highlighter"" with the operative word in that description being ""Highlighter"".  Yep, these are really nice highlighters.  I had not noticed that in their name before, and sure enough, when I used them to highlight text, written, or printed, in books, magazines, etc., they work great!  5 stars.But if you make the mistake that I did and try and use these as DVD/CD markers, you will be disappointed.  Use Sharpies that are labeled for that use, and you will be happy.  But these are not those."
824,"This is a whiteboard eraser, made if a blue sponge glued to a white sponge.  Yes, it does erase whiteboards (assuming you are erasing dry erase markers).  And, it erases about as good as any other eraser that I've usedPros* it works* can easily wash the dry ink dust out of it (I used a little dish-washing soap, and just worked it a little, and it came clean)Cons* even with great Amazon pricing, it sort of expensive for 2 sponges (these are not that fancy)* no handle, so you are holding the sponge (I used the white side to clean, and used the blue side to hold onto it)"
824,"How many envelopes do you know of that have their own patent!  Yes, these envelopes do, and they are nice.  I use mine in a laser printer, and I have no issues with jamming (no more than any other standard envelope, depending on how your printer pulls them through).What's unique about these, is a small flap on the back, that you lift to expose the sticky tape stuff, so when you then close the flap on the envelope it will seal tight, no licking, or water, no additional tape needed.  The insides of these are printed with a blue hash design to prevent people from reading the letter through the envelope (this works well, I tested it).  Once sealed, if you (or someone trying to get into your mail that should not be) tries to open the envelope by lifting the sealed flap, it's perforated so it tears a little and makes it obvious that it was tampered with.  I tried to open one that was sealed, as a test, and yes, it did tear, so it was obvious that it had been opened."
824,"I got one of these tape dispensers just before Christmas, that dispenses pre-cut pieces of tape:Scotch PopUp Tape Handband Dispenser, 0.75 x 2 Inches, 75 Strips per Pad, 1 Pad per Pack (Colors May Vary) (96-G)Yes, the pre-cut pieces of tape were of a use-able and good length, and they came out of the dispenser just fine, and it was kind of fun.  But, strap this to my hand? or arm?  I don't think so!  That part of the design was just not good in my opinion.  I could see this more useful in a desktop dispenser, but I'm sure the idea was for people needing it right there next to their work, maybe for scrap-booking or something.  I don't know that I have ever seen refills for this type of dispenser at a local easy-access discount store, but maybe at an office store or a craft store you could find some.  If someone gives you one of these, have fun with it, and you will find it useful too.  But I don't think I'd go out of my way to buy one of these."
2857,"Avery NoteTabs stylishly and sturdily replace flimsy tabs, no-longer-sticky sticky notes, and dog earred bits of paper and index cards.I used these in my moleskine to more effectively divide my notebook up into usable, more functional, and more organized resource.The NoteTabs have a more permanent feel than any other solutions I have tried- the plastic is stiff and has a pleasant lightly textured feel.  The adhesive is very grippy and I trust it more than the previous strips of post it note I had resorted to useing.  These also look much more professional and neat which for me is important as I often take my moleskine with me on appointments.  The plastic easily accepts writing and doesn't destroy pens or smudge the way many plastics do- Avery calls this a paper overlay but whatever it is it's almost magically integrated into their products).I do like the colors- nice and fresh, though the package would be much more useful had they included more colors in the colorway rather than just two, as many folks use color coding to organize and move them quickly through their materials. Though if color coding is that important folks can buy the other colors Avery offers."
2857,"I expected that these would have one of two possible outcomes (they would stick and not remove cleanly or they wouldn't stick at all) but this is Avery- these folks know labels/stickers!I tested these on a bottle of cleaning solution (vinegar & water in a spray bottle) and while they are removable- the look and feel is that of permanent labels until you actually try to pull it off and then it comes off easily (like a window cling)- leaving no residue.I would use these for temp labeling and household organization projects.  Of course, for long term or heavy duty labeling I would suggest a more permanent label solution (as I don't know how long these hold their stick or how durable long term, they are).I prefer the look of the ""assorted borders"" version of these labels, but that is personal preference. These would be helpful for color-coding projects or filing small projects (as there are only three colors)Here are the ones I like- a little more old-school meets modern as far as aesthetics:Avery Removable Label Pad, 1 x 3 Inches, Assorted Borders, 120 Labels (22014)"
2857,"These are basic, white paper file folder labels.  They are usable in inkjet and laser printers.The adhesive is strong with instant/fast grip with minimal smoothing down and the edges don't readily pull up.I would trust that these would last quite some time (except in a more humid environment as I imagine inkjet printing would bleed)...These labels are pretty basic, I don't know that I would seek them out specifically for a filing project.My only issue with these is that the paper is extremely thin, so if you are relabeling you may have some show through, which may be an aesthetic issue for some people.  I like my new files to have a crisp, clean, finished look while reusing folders from my past system.  The show through didn't give it that crisp look so I wound up turning the folders inside out and problem solved.All in all these are good labels and a good value. Only time will tell how well these stick in the long term, so I will check back and update after they have been in rotation for a good span of time."
2857,"I'm a wrapper.  You may not recognize my name here but I send out new hits every day.Seriously.  I make jewelry and during the holidays my days are spent giftwrapping treasures and shipping them off to all corners of the Earth.  I use a lot of tape.I also have a small child, so I have elf duties.Did I mention that I have rheumatoid arthritis and my hands are cranky beasts during gift wrapping season?  Oh and I am absent minded, so there may be 20 rolls of Scotch tape in my studio but still I can't find any. (The same goes for my reading glasses, I often find three pairs perched on top of my head when I look in the mirror)Enter the fantastic Scotch Pop-Up Tape assortment of awesome!Basically these are little strips of tape in a pile and dispensers to allow them to dispense one strip at a time.Two of the dispensers are for the wrist- I actually wear it on the back of my knuckles so I look like a gangsta wrapper.  Actually, it gives my knuckles a little extra compression so I can work longer. This may not work as such for everyone, but for me it is a bonus.Two of the dispensers are for smooth, flat surfaces. These are the coolest!  They have a rubber diaphragm on the back that acts like a suction cup and grips flat surfaces enough that you can pull out a piece of tape with the bonus of being able to move it, if your wrapping 'hood should change.  AND there is no sticky stuff all over the surface that you have to pick at with your nails or a putty knife. There are two, so I can keep one at my work area and one where other folks can use it for their adhesive needs, and I can still put them away in a drawer for the next wrap attack.In general, I like the design and concept- for my needs, wrapping small jewelry size boxes, the tape strips are a little too long , but for wrapping all of those gifts from Santa (he, and his elven charges, are too busy to wrap, he makes all of the resident grownups do it for him- that's how he can get to all of those places in one night.  It's all about delegation.) it's absolutely perfect and made wrapping gifts not only faster but easier- no more playing twister while holding a piece of paper just so and rooting around for the roll of tape.  Actually, the first couple of times I did root around looking for the tape, because I forgot that it was on the back of my hand.If you giftwrap at least once a month, I think this is a great investment."
2857,"I think I goofed and the product description threw me... ""Write labels by hand or print with laser and inkjet printers""A word of advice- make sure you choose the labels that suit the type of printer you have.I see that ""laser"" was in the title, but as someone who labels and relabels during organization binges, I must have assumed I wouldn't bother printing anything temporary, as I usually only commit to a printed label once I am 100% sure of what I am labeling.Anyway, the colors are bold 1980's neon.  Eyecatching, to say the least. I like slightly less saturated labels typically that offer a bit more contrast, but if relying solely on color coding for organization these are useful.  Having slightly compromised vision makes me see the neon and ignore the printed stuff on the label, but color coding is for efficiency and instant recognition, so this shouldn't be an issue for most people.As far as the presentation of the labels- I don't know how it is with an inkjet version of this product- but the laser labels are on standard sized sheets and they don't have that wasted label material surrounding the labels.  For me that's a huge plus- I have arthritis in my hands and hand tremors and especially during the holiday shipping season I am constantly battling it out with labels that I have trouble getting off the backing as the scoring/cut at the edges of the label isn't wide enough to get a fingernail grip or because the label material is thin and tears.  These are great- they come off so easily I wasn't totally confident that they would really stick well to anything.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that they stick a little better than regular post it notes (I attribute this to the fact that they are totally flush with the paper's surface rather than having a flap that can pull on the adhesive and weaken the seal)...So, at the end of my office and workshop organizing day, I can find a use for these- though that use can be equally matched by a padded version of sticky labels, rather than sheets made for a specific type of printer. I would also like a more modern color scheme, or at least an updated version of ""neon"" that is easier on the eyes, but maybe these blend well with previous shades of color coding labels from other lines....?"
2857,"I'm a Post-It brand notes fan from way back, but in some situations that little strip of removable adhesive and a freely flapping piece of paper don't stay put as much as I need them to.These are handy for situations where you want a little more permanence or just security, but still want the flexibility of a removable note.These are great for temporary (but secure) labeling of:giftswork piles/papersorting and organizingThese particular pads are around the size of a business card, small enough for a quick note or a short list.These were cleanly removable from all of the surfaces I tested- wood table, metal cabinet, notebook paper, glass table, fridge... They restuck fairly well, but did have more curling at the corners than the initial application, but if you need something more durable you are probably considering a more permanent label.The colors are very vivid and easy to spot. Great when organizing things or if you lose a pad in a pile of papers (guess how I know? :-)"
2857,"I love Post-It notes, or I thought I did.  I think I just like the square note paper with the adhesive edge, but the roll of Post-It's?  Yeah, that has my allegiance now.These are awesome.  First of all, the adhesive runs down the entire width and length of one face of this paper.  That is a major plus because the free-flapping edge of a traditional post it note can catch on something else, or just get blown about so much that it becomes unstuck and then nothing gets done or remembered.  Second, you can rip these off to the exact length you need and as it's longer than it is wide, you can write lengthy messages in giant bold letters so nobody (I'm looking at my co-parent) can declare that they didn't see the note.I've used them for numbers to remember, taking messages, writing down doctor's appointments while on the phone that do eventually go in my iPod touch's calendar, but then I can stick the note as a reminder where I'll see it and won't forget it even after I mute reminders a bunch of times.  I've used this as a temporary wrap label for my Ball jelly jars.  No, they aren't intended for fridge/freezer use, but we aren't canning, just using the jars for storage and as we eat fresh and pretty basic foods, they are consumed quickly, so for a couple of days in the fridge, or (so far) weeks out of the fridge, wrapped all of the way around a Ball jar, these are fantastic and the green sticks out well, so we aren't losing food to spoilage with the same frequency, which is a definite plus. I keep coming up with new ways that these are useful around the house.  The plastic roll is like a giant tape roll... I wonder if I can increase the style by loading these into a fancy tape dispenser... I'll report back after I try it...I will definitely be choosing the roll version of Post-It's over the flappy note paper squares version from now on."
2857,"These are incredibly easy to assemble (yes, there are instructions right on the box if you need some reassurance) and wonder of wonders- you don't need rolls of packing tape to prep them for packing up your treasures.Moving is complete sensory overload and full of stress.  I think if packing up my million boxes for another move, not having that nerve jarring screech of packing tape dispenser would mellow it out- just a little.  Not to mention, last minute trips to find more packing tape would be obsolete. I can see how these could save time and money.As far as sturdiness- I was impressed with the feel of the assembled box- the bottom felt sturdy and reinforced, the sides sturdy enough and the fold over flaps offered a little extra hand cushioning to the built in handles.If assembling a cross-country move or one involving longer term storage I would probably use tape or something else to cover the handles- as I would be concerned about stowaways if warehoused or in transit for a long time.I am using these to pack up books we aren't using and art supplies- and they are perfect for stacking on the top shelf of our shelving unit/storage closet.  The fold on top does make these less stable when stacked than flat top boxes- but just a couple high doesn't make a huge difference, and I'm guessing that stacking a few loaded boxes on top would compress just enough that it wouldn't make a difference either- especially if properly secured in the moving container (key to the survival of anything you ship or move-complimentary to good packaging!).This small size is perfect for books, CD's, DVD's and I think they are perfect for smaller, breakable goods and collectibles (with plenty of bubblewrap and newspaper)."
2857,"The Bankers Box Stackable Storage Box in ""Large"" is indeed quite large.  They ship in a large flat-pack and require some assembly, which is fairly easy and quick and results in a fairly sturdy box with plastic handgrips on the side ""carry"" holes/grips and two clear plastic windows (the plastic is thin, like an overhead projector film/acetate) on one side.I will only be using these for shorter-term storage, or longer term storage but only in a climate controlled environment.  I wouldn't suggest these for storage of anything of value or archival in a garage, basement, attic, etc as the handgrip holes, as well as the sheet of plastic that is not stuck on but rather wedged between cardboard edges (during assembly) may make this box a haven for tiny critters.  I was hoping to use these for stashing archival paperwork from home and business, but I am concerned about silverfish/firebrats and other bugs making our documents their new homes... This problem can be solved, somewhat, by gluing on the plastic window or edging it with tape, and also taping over the handle-holes, but I guess you could say that ""just out of the box"" I wouldn't recommend it.What these are fantastic for is interim storage.  I hid all of my child's Christmas gifts in one of these boxes (I covered the interior of the windows with newspaper) and it was much nicer looking than the stack of Amazon boxes I usually have taking over my entire closet this time of year.I also like keeping one of these in our laundry room as a place for goods which need a new home- stuff for cousins and goodwill and such...  The black and white decorator print makes everything look much neater than just a ratty old box.  I will be securing the plastic window on the 2nd box for more intermediate-storage of odds and ends...  Documents will be put in a more secure (and less pretty) Bankers Box."
2857,"I had previously tried the shorter version of these and I really liked them, but I also felt that the longer version would suit me better.I like the 7.5 inch ones a bit more as it gives a more continuous look to the page it is on, whereas the shorter version aesthetically felt more like a block"
