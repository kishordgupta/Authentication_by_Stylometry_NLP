1198, . "This item has 4 sections with three perorations to customize the size.Things I like1. Even on light weight paper (like those in the dummies books) it does not damage the paper or remove ink even when take off and placed back on several times2. Very easy to read text through the plastic3. Even Sharpies do not bleed through this heavy plastic4. The first section with the `tab' makes a great tool for marking chapters or frequently referenced sections5. Heavy duty (stays put even when turning heavy pages)6. I ended up tearing the other three sections off (all 4 sections were really too long for the books I was using them with).  Separated from the tab I used them toa. Folding two tabs over each other again became a great place holder that I used to take notes on.b. Each section by themselves attach flat and neatly on the page a great place to put notes that look much better than the typical sticky and more secure than a piece of paperWhat bothered me1. As noted above the full length of the tab was too long for the books I was using.  Might be great for  a 8.5 x 11 inch page but not the books I was using2. While it did not remove text on lightweight pages when run up and down on the page the page ended up curling.This is a great tool for helping organize notes . The final finish is not overly glossy but not too matteIt is easy to fill and seals consistently without wrinkles (might be in part due to the thickness of photo paper vs regular paper) . I have been very impressed with this new line of Avery products.Like others in this line I can place this and lift it off several times (have done it 8x and still feel it adheres readily and securely).I have been using these to help keep track of my meeting notes and my to do items.These have also been helpful in organizing information for special projects I am working on.  I use the tab to note a place in a book then use the square surface to note how I see implanting the information into the project.These are fairly thick and durable.  And that is the one draw back for me.  I wish these were just a bit thinner.  However that does not distract too much from this great inovative product. . I like to reuse my files however I also do not want to stack label on top of label or tear a regular label off a file and have an unsightly torn mess.I love these labels because1. They come off cleanly2. Label lifts off on surfaces (able to move 7x and still felt it was adhering securely)3. Feeds cleanly through both my top and bottom feeding printers4. Ink adheres well to the surface with no smudges5. When using a marker like a sharpie it does not bleed through to the surface below . "Places these to not hold up1. Any surface with a curve or that is uneven2. Any surface that is dusty or dirty (attempted on a wall that had spackle from fixing a whole in the drywall - did not stick)3. Did not stick well to the cloth on my cubical wallWhat surprised me1.  They do gain back sticky when rinsed.  I took the one that feel of the spackle surface and initially it did not want to stick.  Rinsed it . These tabs are great for marking chapters in a book or frequently used pages.What I like:1. they are heavy duty2.  even on light paper do not damage the paper or remove the ink from the page.3. nice large surface for writing on4. lift off easily5. can be lifted off and put back on several times (I have done it 5 x and they still adhered well) . Like most Avery product this is a great way to create professional looking tickets at home.Ink from my inkjet and laser printer adheres well.  The finished look is clean and professional.  --  Great for non-profit and school events.Also like most Avery product it always seems to cost more than I really want to pay. . The package I received has 4 sheets each of the following colors:A bright pink (however not what I would call neon)Strong solid yellowLime green (bordering on neon)Pastel blueI took one label on and off surfaces 8 times.  Each time it lifted off easily without damaging the paper or lifting off ink.  Even after 8 lifts and place even the corners of the sticker laid flat.The sheets move easily through my top feeding inkjet printer and my bottom feeding laser printer.Sharpies do not bleed through the paper to the surface below.Since all of the back of the sticker is sticky it does not crumple or catch like the typical office sticky note; however unlike most labels it does not damage the surface of the paper/folder when you lift it off. . "These are good basic plain all purpose 4 1/8"" x 9 1/2"" envelopes(note as of today the picture on the Amazon page does not match the product)Things I like1. No waste -  most self sealing envelopes have a plastic strip that needs to be lifted off.  With these all you need to do is lift the flap and seal.  No extra mess.  The flap seems to be fully recyclable.2. The envelopes have a blue security printing on the inside.  This makes it difficult to see printed material inside the envelope.3. Once sealed remain sealed.  I tried to open a sealed envelope right after closing.  The flap tore in clearly indicating that the envelope was tampered with.Things that were awkward but not deal breakers1. It took a bit to hold the flap up so the envelope could seal.  Nothing big but just a moment or two of extra dexterity2. Looking at the box I see no note of recycled content.  Typically when purchasing office paper products I like product that have recycled content. Again not a deal breaker.3. The paper appears rather thin but with the security imprinting the contents are not revealed.  But overall appears as durable as any basic envelope.Over all basic envelope with a nice sealing feature." . This was easy to mount and I also feel it will come off easy as well when I need it to.I like that I was able to choose how close or how far apart I wanted to place the hangers.  This allowed me to place it securely on a narrow (apx 1-inch) foot for my monitor riser.  The pen and Post-its are in convenient reach where I need it the most but yet not cluttering my desk space. (see picture)The hook-like hangers allow for the Post-It holder to be easily removed and the pull away mounts remove easily from surfaces (I've used them on painted walls and have been able to remove them with no damage to the wall or paint). .

The card stock is a nice quality . "This a one touch binder . "Love this labels.  Very bright colors . "These are little paper envelopes with sticky tapes on the back that hold a very small amount of post-it notes.  The premise is that you can stick them to your laptop for convenience.  I suppose if you are on a flight with your laptop open and need a post-it note . "These little note tabs are perfect.  All of those scrappy bookmarks . "Like everyone in these hard economic times . "These tabs are great.  They are particularly handy for teaching a class or making presentation.  They give you the tab for marking your place and also a clear transparent sheet to mark your place or highlight certain areas.  Great idea. My only complaint is that Avery puts too few of their products in a package.  There are 12 per pack here . "I love these repositionable tabs for organizing.  I work doing clincial billing and they are very useful in marking my place among client ledgers . "Post-it has come out with a winner of a product here.  The labels are as advertised super sticky . "I might be thinking of this a little early--but these would make great stocking stuffers for teenagers.  Get a pack of these . "3M makes good products and this is no exception.  But I find it difficult to use them as they are so tiny.  Mail people would need a magnifying glass to read the return address.  I also do not need 2000 labels at a time.  I like that Post-it and 3M put more than 100 labels in their packages but for my needs 2000 is way too many . It doesn't seem like a big thing--but peeling the strip off the self-seal envelopes can be a pain and those strips end up everywhere.  These are a nice quality envelope that closes so easily--very very handy.  Hopefully this idea will catch on to other products.I would recommend this product. . "This is as indicated on the front of the binder
289, . "Well . "Avery's perforated NoteTabs are an interesting hybrid office product:  a repositionable Index Tab wedded to custom-sizeable ""PostIt"" notes with an unusual twist:  they're transparent on the page.These perforated NoteTabs are really unique.  Each one is about 7-3/4 inches long and 3 inches wide.  Each individual NoteTab has a rigid . "These whiteboard markers come in gorgeous .

"I used these in my printer to get my return address and logo pre-printed on them. The ink worked well . "So these work just fine . "I really do like this.  But I have not found a magnetic surface in my house that holds it well.  Sticking it to the wall is my only option . "These come in bright green and bright pink color . "These are great
1224, . These are much better than the thin rectangular flags I'm used too. The half circle shape and thicker product resists crumpling and tearing. Works great and lasts longer! . "I love the one touch opener and the D ring design with pins and sockets that make ripping the holes when turning pages a thing of the past. Those are the key pluses. The binder holds more for its size and is a pleasure to use.I also like the four (or 2+ extra access) internal pockets. However . "3M has come up with another winner. These labels are basically Post-it notes but with weak sticky stuff covering one whole side . "This roll is something like a cross between masking tape and Post-it notes. You can write on it better than masking tape and it adheres more firmly than Post-it notes but can still be removed fairly easily. Makes a handy label but if you want it neat . "I'm constantly writing articles. These Avery NoteTabs are great for marking pages in books.  Nice and stiff . These are the quickest boxes I've used for setup. The size is great for lots of items but probably not books or paper. Also breaks down easily for storage before reuse. Can't be beat. . "Great set of tabs. I recently used them in marking and organizing a book for review. They can be handled over and over again without tearing and they are wide . "Ouch! I was just about to sit down to write a rave review. The product had been performing as advertised (dropper applicator worked fine and cap wasn't getting stuck). However . "I'm probably decades behind the rest of the world. When I was working in an office my secretary used to do this stuff. Anyway .

Good high quality tabs.  Wont break easily.  Looks nice and stands out boldy when applied to the folder.  What more can you ask for? . Been using these a few weeks and so far and happy with them.  Less pricey than the competition but just as functional. Color coding helps with separating folders visually.  Time will tell if the hangers are reinforced enough to support heavier files but so far so good. . Good labels.  Sticks well and wont peel off over time as may some of the other generic brands.  I put these on older ragged folders too (we recycle folders for years) and they didn't have any problem sticking. . "The pad is very attractive looking on a desk and hefty enough that it doesn't squirm away when writing on.  The feature here is you can access all the colors without having to break apart the ""cubes"" as in 3M's brand. However . "These are terrific high quality sticker labels.  There's a nice smell to them and they stick so well.  The colors are bold so they stand out to ensure your eyes point directly at them when trying to find the print you need.  I don't even bother using a printer . Nice idea but the holder is rather clunky and doesn't dispense the post-it notes as well as it should.  I eventually just tossed it out and used the post-its raw. . Good labels.  Have used generic ones and they always just don't last.. peels off after time but these Averys wont do that.  Important in this case since you don't want your shipping label peeling off in mid transit.  Spend the extra money and get the quality you need. One lost package will cost you a lot more. . "I pack this in my carry case when making business calls.  Regular scotch tape is bulky and gets dust trapped underneath the exposed area.  No such problems with this unit.  Tape is thick and high quality.Only con is that these are expensive for the size . "These folders are built well and are colorful.  Most important trait is of course

What we typically do is to shrink them down to half size and then have them laminated - which is where this little unit comes in handy!The laminator was easy to setup and is very easy to use once it's warmed up.  The output quality seems just as good as the lamination we were having done at OfficeMax - and it's much more convenient.Overall . "We deal with a lot of federal documents; and . "As a C/C++ programmer . "These labels have been great for organizing not only folders . "This is one of those things that someone should have thought of years ago.  These retractable highlighters are far more convenient than the traditional caps.  Most of the colors are nice and bright . "These labels are absolutely perfect for labeling reloaded ammo boxes.  I basically run them through my laser printer to print a basic template that includes: date . "It seems like I buy more and more items online these days - which has also resulted in more online returns.  My previous process was to print a return label on normal paper . "This pop-up tape dispenser is a life saver when it comes to bulk present wrapping.  It slides onto my hand easily and is far easier to use than a standard roll of tape.  It's the kind of thing that leaves me wondering why someone didn't think of it before?Having said that; I'm a little torn on this product since it is such a great idea . These labels are easy to run through my laser printer using the standard Avery 5160 template.  They look great after printing and they stay in place on the envelope.It's hard to think of much wrong with a product like this that does exactly what it says it will do.

"These markers write in deep bold colors and erase from dry erase boards easily. They're described as fine tip . "Great simple labels. I use the for my paperwork at my place of employment. They look a bit more professional then the typical yellow or orange square sticky note I had been using and look good for writing notes that I affix to papers for other co-workers. You can read them better then the colored stick notes . "These labels work nice and stick well. They are a little small for using on a large box though. I would say these work for small to medium sized boxes . "The 2 desk-grip dispensers work quite interestingly. They are not sticky on the bottom like I thought they would be. They hold to smooth surfaces . "What makes these different then every other label out there is the glue they use. These are removable . "I have had the envelops in the past that you peal the waxy paper off the glued area and then you seal the envelope. While they are grate for most climates . I have tried using post-it's in the past while working on things for labeling. This if course ends up not working because the post-it's stick out where there is no adhesive on them and get knocked off or fall off. I then end up just using a piece of tape to attach the post-it.These is the solution for that problem. Giving you a post-it with the ability to have a fully adhesive back to it. I can;t believe they didn't think of this a  long time ago!

"Especially in these economic times . "These tabs . So many certificates and other documents I wanted to safeguard and display.  This laminator works quickly and efficiently. The best part is that it won't take up a lot of space between uses. . "While there is of course another brand which has become synonymous with sticky notes . "Since Scotch is the go-to maker of transparent tape . "The problem with using double-stick tape for mounting photos and other flat items is that you have to get it right the first time.

"Even if these 3M whiteboard erasers cleaned equally well as felt erasers . "The flaw in most self-sealing envelopes is that there is a backing to pull off.  This envelope is designed with a flap which unfolds . "At first I was shocked at the cost of this binder . "I am a major consumer of Post-It notes.  In addition to always having a pad of them in my suit jacket pocket . "This item is advertised as the ""ultimate"" in tape delivery . "Because I like to place folders of materials I want to be able to find easily within case folders . "Sticky notes have become so essential to me that I am rarely without them

"These Post-It sized notes with tabs are simply the best I've ever used. Each note has a traditionally-sized tab so that bookmarks and notes are one in the same . "There's no denying it: I was born an office supply junkie . "These Avery labels are about as close to perfect as they can be. As a small business owner who's rabidly ADD . "Simply put . "These Post-it labels are made to use in laser or ink jet printers. The brilliant colors -- green . "I've probably been living in a turnip patch .

The colors are pretty but the functionality is not all that different from 3M's sticky notes.  This is a great size for multi-purpose uses. . "These 2 inch durable post-its are great for notes as well as marking pages for future reference.  I especially like their different colors so that I can use them for different purposes - yellow for signatures . I often use folders for a few weeks and then throw them away once the project is completed.  This product enables me re-use folders.  It saves me money and enables me to produce less waste.  Win-win! . Well-made folders.  I especially love the nice colors and the ability to handwrite on the tabs!  They are far better than the standard dark green issues of old. . These labels use the Avery templates and are very easy to peel off.  What is there not to like? . I agree with the other reviewers about Post-its falling off or curling due to the small adhesive area.  These are far better with 100% adhesive at the back.  I can now stick these on virtually anywhere without worrying about them falling off or curling.  Love it!The only downside for these is that you can't really print on these with your printer due to the odd size.  It's not a deal breaker for me since I usually use pen or market anyway. . "It is super sticky and reusable . I am not sure why there is a need for this product.  Can you just stick a book of regular stickie to the side of your computer?  Why pay more??? . I re-use my bottles for aromatherapy.  These labels are great as they allow for mess-free removal when I change the contents of the bottle.  I highly recommend these labels. . I have been using Avery labels in the past and these 3M labels are as good as those Avery ones at a cheaper price.  I actually like these a bit better since they are easier to peel off with the space between each column of labels.  There is no noticeable difference between the paper quality of the two brands.  I can also use my old Avery templates with these labels.
1708, . "The good:*They are pretty easy to assemble . "These are excellent page markers! They are 7/16''x1 3/4'' . "I use both Post it and Avery sticky notes and I can't tell any difference between the two. I even put one of each on the fridge and peeled it off and on 30+ times and both had equal stick. I would buy either brand based on price alone . This is the neatest product! You get four different color bordered tabs and each color comes in a stack of 6 much like sticky notes. They are made of a durable yet paper thin acetate so they don't add any thickness when a lot of paper is stacked or inside a book to mark pages. The writing surface is a mat finish which is great for markers but if you use pencil it was surprising to me you could erase it and reuse them. These are like regular tabs having sticky on the bottom 2/3 of the back but the side you write on is on the opposite side. So the entire 2''x1.5'' is exposed on the page or folder in other words they don't go to the back of a folder or page they go on top so you will see the whole 2x1.5 tab. Actually the entire area is the same texture so you can make notes on the whole thing not just the 1/3 at the top in white. This is very cool for using in cookbooks you can make notes on the tab rather then writing on the book! They are also easily removable without damaging the page. Great for flagging a book. I use them in my field study notebooks indicating dates and things of interest so I can easily flip to that page when I need to refer back. I will definitely be buying more of these they are just so great for so many things! . What a cool product this is!I wasn't quite sure what to expect but this little dispenser just floats across the surface with ease leaving behind rows of nearly invisible tiny adhesive dots. Make your own sticky notes on any paper in a snap. Great to put photos in an album or making your own greeting cards or any paper project where you want sticky but no tape. It is also great fun to use if you can believe that. GREAT product! I would definitely buy this product and recommend it for sure! . "I really like these little sticker pads especially these with the outlined border for using on file folders. They come in three colors all on one solid backing so they all stay together. They have sticky on the entire back and stay in place very securely but they are removable with no tearing or mess left behind. The rounded tab has no sticky so you can easily pull off one at a time and the tab can be left on for labels you will be removing frequently or removed for a more permanent but still removable application. Very handy product. I like the borderless ones even better especially for use in making notes in a cookbook they have a light solid color with no border leaving more room for writing. These are more for labeling things like file folders or boxes and binders. Great product . These are perfect for labeling file folders with a non-removable label. They really stick! They cover most of the tab area on a file folder being 3-7/16'' long and 2/3'' tall. You can print on these using a template and they are for both inkjet as well as laser printers. They are also great to hand write on and use for other applications besides just on file folders. The adhesive really sticks like all of the quality 3M adhesive products. Only one complaint if I had to find one and that would be that like all labels on the market the white ones are all on the see through side. If you are placing a label over writing or another printed label the one behind will show through a bit. Not a huge problem really but they all seem to have this in common. Overall this is an excellent product and it gets 5 stars in my book! . "I didn't care for this product right from the time I started to try and figure out how to load it . "These are great labels and much better then the label pads this company makes where you can't tear off at the perforation without leaving an ugly jagged edge. These are on a sheet of wax paper so you just peel and stick. I just write on them with a pen but I don't see why my inkjet wouldn't print on them even though the package only says ""Laser"". I like that you can remove them once you've put them in place and I like that you have 4 colors. They have nice clean rounded corners so they look professional and neat. Great product with really strong adhesive yet removable!" . "I would give this 5 stars for great adhesive and removability but the little tear off piece is terrible. The perforation is useless leaving a jagged ugly edge. I understand why they tried to market it this way since people are use to the pad form of Post-it products but these would have been much more user friendly had they left them as individual wax paper backed labels and sold them in the same zip lock storage pouch they already came in.I much prefer their product called Color-Coding Labels sold in an 8.5x11 sheet size format with waxed paper backing for easy removable labels. There are 4 colors rather then just two and they have clean rounded edges for a much nicer finished look. They can be printed on with your printer (the package I received was for laser

The ""Smear Guard"" is comparable to other highlighters.I'm a self described pen junkie.  I've always taken very detailed notes - I find the key is to use different colors and highlighters to separate thoughts or to draw connections between items.

1043, . "Avery likes to call these gems Note Tabs Round but I have know the brand so long I still call them labels.  They are perfect for what they are.  They tell me where I want to be when I need to find something in a book or file.  The round edge makes it easy to use and the color makes it easy to see.  The first thing I noticed is the thickness of the label.  It is unlike what I grew up with in the dark ages.  It is thick enough to last and not fall apart.  However . "To say it is just a label is an understatement.  It performs all the tasks I expect from a label; however . Theses are handy little notes and work just perfectly.  I installed one pack on my laptop and never realized how handy a note could be until I wanted to write a URL on a piece of scrape paper.  This dispenser fit the bill perfectly and with the adhesive on the back of the note it helped me later when using the URL on the desktop.  It is out of the way and does not interfere with the laptop's operation.  It does provide an extra cushion when closing the screen.  Nice touch.Most of the time I am never satisfied with a single use product and run with the thought that there might be another use for this or that product.  This is the case with these notes.  I am often looking for a piece of paper to write a note or reminder while in the car.  Most current note paper is unsatisfactory for my needs until this product entered the scene.  Boom!  A new use.  I applied another pack to an area close to the wheel but out of the way so that when I filled the gas tank I had a piece of paper to write the data about the gas filling.  Can you imagine a day without numbers?  The notes are handy if I need to write a person's license number and now I will not have to scrounge for that ever elusive piece of paper.  While in many cases a voice recorder would work better there are times when it is not available or run down or just too worrisome to worry about.Great product and worthy of finding other uses.  I'm on itg boss! . O.K. one might say it is just a pack of Post-It Notes.  I agree with one exception.  These are the perfect notes for placing information on a larger container rather than the standard sizes we grew up with.  My first use for them was to place identifier on stored documents contained in a plastic box.  The size is large enough to provide for large numbers and then permit additional identification in smaller print.  The peel off easy from the pad and stick well on the container.  Removing them from the container is simple and there is no residue.  These are simply perfect for most uses when you need to see what you wrote and subsequently want to remove it. . "I really like these note tabs.  The are big enough so that I can write in large letters so that I can see them when I need to without the assistance of readers.  What makes them so good for me is that they stick almost anywhere I want them to stick and when necessary . "About two hours before this gem arrived I sought decent tape to close a box.  My old stand bye was the only thing I had and it was the usual struggle of getting the tape to start and then cutting it if I were lucky enough to keep it from binding to itself.  Then arrived my new Scotch dispenser and what a wonderful addition to the household helper inventory.  It fits my hands well and is easy to maneuver plus cutting the tape is so much better than other dispensers I have used.  Moreover . "My using these tabs has helped control my outbursts considerably.  When going to a tab made out of cheap . "It is almost impossible to visit an office supply store and Not find a new Scotch product and that is wonderful.  The latest addition to a sea of goodies is the Dot Roller.  It is an abundant 49 feet of convenient material that really works.  Once readey after setting it up it holds most items quite well.  I tested several items with great success.  The fridge is the resting place for all those doctor's appointments and here we have a bunch.  Thank goodness for a large fridge.  I digress.  The normal application was magnest holding the appointment cards but not now.  About 1/2 to one inch of Dot Roller on the back of the card holds the card on the metal quite well.  Of the first batch I placed not one has fallen to the floor.  That includes the piece of 8x5 paper for Jury Duty notification which has been removed several times but is still sticking much like that little bunny keeps on running.  The only failure has been my application of a 1/2 inch long strip to the card that held the product.  It held only one day; however . "I still recall the first so called silly glue or crazy glue or whatever it was called.  I could not wait to buy those two little tubes that brought moments of glee and required perfect mixing with rapid application of consistent pressure only to find that your fingers stuck to the item.Now . 3M has proven consistently that they are a reputable international company with products that work well over and over.  The 2 piece set of their Whiteboard Erasers fit that category.  They work well and are a much needed to making whiteboards even better.  They are a perfect fit for either hand and make the process so easy.  When finished I wash mine and let them air dry for the next use.  I added using them to clean my LCD screens on either monitors or TVs and they work well with a small amount of distilled water.  It's best not to have much water so the amount of streaking is eliminated.  Great product from a great company.  Who could ask for any more? . "Hey . "There may be 5 or 6 persons around here who have not used my old favorite Pop-Up Notes.  But then again we have a lot of folks living in the back woods solely for the purpose of making moonshine and the demand for Post-it Notes is close to zero.  I think that is because only one edge has glue on it and it sticks poorly to the Mason Jar.  This new dispenser is ever so handy and so simple to use.  The whole process from opening the package to using the first note is quite simple and intuitive.  Why even a mountain person could do it.  I know.  Add the four stickums on the back and there is a perfect note dispenser.  I put mine on the fridges (kitchen and garage) so when some food runs out I have a note to make myself a note.  That may sound simple to some but wait and see as age works against you.  Added my own marking pen and away I went making notes galore.  Well

"Having had to move several times in the past five years I've put together my share of ""banker's boxes"".  With these I was looking forward to an improved version of the product -and one that looked more stylish and rugged than the typical box.I think the boxes are fine . "I was hoping for a better product than what this turned out to be: the paper is not as sticky as it should be . "I used these all the time for work and home . "I was really pleased with this product.Yes it took me about a minute to figure out -I was upside down- but once I realized the plastic cover (once retracted) should face the ground (versus the ceiling) it worked like a charm.If you've ever used correction tape . "Superglue is usually a pain in the neck -it either clogs up your tube . "The way this ""whiteboard eraser"" was advertised you might think there was something different about it --that is . "Though these weren't EXACTLY as sticky as the 3M standard sticky notes
417, . "Useful and reliable.  I am not sure why but ink does not tend to smear on these labels like it does on others I have purchased.  Bright white . "The tape works fine and the dispenser works fine--especially when compared to those disposable tape varieties.  I just don't really find this product useful.  Unfortunately all projects do not require the same length of tape.  I find that my trusty old Scotch desktop tape dispenser is still my best best.  I can dispense tape at any length I need . "Love these and there are so many ways that they can be used.  It was a bit tricky finding and working with a template but it wasn't too bad.  Great for parties . "I was unimpressed with this product.  The labels are certainly removable but they are not sticky enough.  They do not adhere all that well with the first placement . "These are very convenient especially if you take your laptop from place to place.  The notes are contained within a protective cardboard case so edges don't get damaged and sheets don't pull off when you don't want them.  I think the product is a bit pricey . "Convenient.  Comes with its own dispenser.  This is typical Post-it grade paper and is completely adhesive on the back--not just a strip.  This tape works great for temporry jobs that you may have.  It handles jobs I used to do with Post-It pads--I can quickly attach to anything and easily remove it as well but . "Very handy . "These are very convenient and easily come together.  They are sturdy and the size is very nice--it holds plenty without becoming too heavy.  I would be selective about what is packed in these . Very sturdy and made well.  It has clear-view covers ( and spine) so you can customize as needed.  Hinges open and close smoothly.  Better than your ordinary binder. . "I would like for these flags to have a bit more sticking endurance.  In general they work fine but if you need to move them around with a project they don't always hold up.  I like that there is variety in colors and that the colors are crisp and bright!  Overall . "I love for my files to be nice . Another fine product.  These are sturdy and quite durable.  Tabs can easily be moved for resue in other applications.  They are great for 1/3 tab folders or to make your own dividers for binders.  Easy to write on. . I got these to use for labeling the mailbox unit in my classroom.  I previously used regular labels and always had to scrape remnants at the end of the year.  These do not have the adhesive power to last all year but I placed transparent tape over them.  Removal is a cinch now.  I want my the mailbox unit to last for many more years and this product helps me avoid the buildup from layers of label remains. They work well on temporary files that I must set up also. . Great address label.  Especially reliable stick-ability.  Good product for mailings and labeling  folders and such in the office.  Recommended . "When I first ordered this I thought I would get separate pads . "I really like the additional ""pocket"" on the inside of each cover.  This binder is lightweight yet durable.  I like that the rings close neatly into themselves rather than those claw-type rings.  The shape of the rings makes turning pages much easier.  I especially like that the binder is wider so that dividers do not hang over the side.  Printed material can be organized better with having extra pockets but print is still transferred.  Print can also be transferred in the clear-view covers so I am going to laminate my inserts first." . I like the crisp bold colors. The sticky band is wide enough to ensure good adhesion to multiple surfaces. Paper quality is durable.  I find this product to be superior to Post-It and will now be ordering Avery sticky pads.

You simply peel them off and stick them on the corners of whatever it is that you want to place on the wall. . .window. . etc.  I was going to get a corkboard . I like this brand over some other brands simply because there isn't a strip around the edge and center.  With other brands I usually remove this strip and sometimes the labels come off with it.  This way it just makes it easier to remove the labels. . "These tabs are nice to use when you don't want to add the full-page tabs to something . "These labels are nice.  I have nothing against them . "I haven't had any problems with these labels.  They are really a great size for lots of things including address labels .

"Suppose you have a large paper document . "The size of the sticky note I want to use . "These are fairly standard . "This is a large D-ring binder. It has the usual three rings . "These are standard folders like many I have used and reused for years.  They are indeed quite sturdy.  One side is cut down significantly lower than usual at the tab area (rather than the tab extending out more).  This doesn't affect me much . "This is a cute little block of sticky notes in my favorite size
1173, . "I really like these new 3M labels. They feed perfectly through both my laser and my inkjet printers and are of very high quality. The adhesive sticks like crazy once applied to paper or cardboard . "Although the illustration on the package shows these being used to label plastic storage boxes . "If you print shipping labels with postage from your computer using services like UPS or PayPal's shipping system . "I'm the editor for a small newsletter for a local club . "I wouldn't recommend these to replace the normal style for everyday use . "This is pretty much the Scotch Invisible tape I've known for years . "So many products these days come in every skimpier packaging which makes storage and reuse annoying. These laminating sleeves are the typical 3 mil thick Chinese manufactured ones just like you might find under other brand names. So . "How much can be said about ""sticky notes""? Obviously 3M's original is the benchmark . "I've used many mechanical pencils over the years . "Ever since Eastman introduced ""Eastman 910"" .

382, . These are designed to work seamlessly with the Avery templates built into Word.  I especially appreciate the fact that the excess material around each lable has been peeled off making them easy to remove without causing any jamming problems when printing.  The ink does not smear and they stick well to emvelopes.  I find them to be perfect in every way. . "I like the single touch lever that pops the rings open.  I also like the D-ring style with the rings mounted on the back of the binder rather than the spine.  For me . "Great vibrant colors will really stand out for color coding purposes.  Made to be removable but they are ""Super Sticky"" so they should stay put until peeled off.  Codes are included for both Avery and Post-it templates.  Labels are easy to peel off the sheet once printed because the extra label material between the columns is already peeled away." . I'm sure these will work with whatever printer and software you're used to using for printing shipping labels.  The big advantage here is that the label is designed to paste right over any other label on the box and guarantee a scanner doesn't pick up any barcodes from the label below.  This way you can reuse boxes without having to try and peel off the old lables.  I have no doubt that these will accomplish that.  They are so thick not even Superman could see through them! . "These work with the Avery templates built into Word.  They are ""quick lift"" which means there is bare space between the columns that makes it easy to peel off the labels.

It can accommodate a much wider pouch than the Fellowes model I have but the trade off is that it has a much larger footprint.  The Swingline model also offers a reverse mode and will auto-reverse if it detects a jam. Even the cord seems extra long and extra heavy duty. It comes with a sheet of cardboard you are supposed to feed through after each session to clear out any extraneous adhesive left behind.  The control panel is simple to use and gives a little countdown dial of the wait time until it is ready to use.I thought I would really like the feature where it auto detects the pouch thickness but it turns out that setting just makes it choose the longer warm up cycle (5 minutes instead of just 1)in case you happen to feed in a 10 mil pouch.  If you're only using a 3 mil pouch . "Obviously this product is in competition with Post-Its or store brands like Staples ""Stickies"".  Truthfully . "These have multiple applications.  You can use them as tabs on dividers in a binder or for stand-out tabs on file folders or hanging files.  This particular size has 2 inches of writing space on the tab itself but a ton more room (3"" x 3"")down on the stick-on portion.  You could put the main idea on the tab itself and more detailed notes on the remainder.  They seem sufficiently stiff and sticky to hold up over time . "For use as a tab on divider pages or to make folders stand out beyond the built in tab . "These work with either inkjet or laser printers and are designed to be removable rather than permenant.  This would be a distinct advantage for situations where you want to be able to re-label the item for each subsequent use.  These are ""Super Sticky"" which gives them greater adhesion than a standard Post-it note while still being removable.  They include both Avery Template numbers and Post-it Template numbers.  Labels are not ""quick lift"" but seem easy to peel up." . "Smead FasTab (64201) hanging folders are nice heavy duty hanging files with 2"" expansion bottoms.

587, . "I've been using Avery labels for years and will occasionally by store brand labels if there is a good deal. While similar I think the Avery labels are generally of slightly better quality. I was curious where 3M would fall on the quality scale.I'm very impressed!I set up various label sheets in MS Word (using the compatible Avery 5163 template).  I had no issues whatsoever printing within the margins.  The labels feed smoothly into the printers I used.  The print quality was excellent.  Although suggested for Lasers . "If you like the convenience of the hand held pop up tape dispensers . "Now we can make custom raffle tickets for our non-profit events. We used to use the standard admission style tickets but there was little room on the back for information. Now we can customize the part that the customer fills in (name and phone only . "I love the circular tape dispensers. It's great that they are so lightweight and yet don't lift off your work surface when you pull the tape out.The hand held dispensers are great when you need a hand.I love having a multi pack so I can throw a dispenser in each room of the house.Now for the downsides:The circular dispenser only sticks to flat surfaces so trying to use it on a kitchen table with a tablecloth is a joke. (Probably not really it's intended use . "Although listed as laser printers . "Love these labels!Rather than printing on paper and affixing it with tape . "These tabs are nice and sturdy. The adhesive is similar to post-its - strong but removable. The tabs are repositionable so you can reuse them (or reapply them if you put them on crooked).Each tab comes attached to 3 transparent squares that also have the repositionable adhesive on the back.  You can put these on sheets to make notes or highlight without marking up the actual pages. I'm not sure how often I'll be using these. I would prefer to have more tabs and fewer transparent squares.It's a little more difficult than I expected to tear the tabs/dividers apart.  It's not terribly hard . "I love these labels.  How many times have you ""opened a file"" on something only to find it wasn't needed or you already had one? With these you can easily remove the label and fasten a new one with a different file name.  I usually handwrite my labels and when I can reuse a folder I turn it inside out and put a new label on the outside. Now I can just remove the label and put a new one on it.  There's nothing to cross off or peel off on the back.My only gripe is that the labels are a lot thinner (more see through) than traditional labels and I don't really understand why. I have tried many 3M/Post-It labels and these are considerably thinner.  The are still good quality but I was disappointed that I can't place them over the folders I already have because the handwriting or old labels show through.Overall a great bet though. I highly recommend them.  No issues with printing whatsoever." . "I'm a little surprised by all of the positive reviews here to be honest.The tabs are much thicker than I anticipated. I started thinking they'd be able to hold heavier sheets of paper (thick construction paper . "Wow. These were much smaller than I anticipated.  Yes . I have to say I was a little skeptical about this product. I couldn't imagine it would be easy to tear out a middle sheet without tearing the paper or ripping apart the pad.I was wrong.This pad is wonderful.  There is a thick and sturdy binding around the pad that keeps the different pads together.  You can easily grab the color or size that you need and pull it out without ripping the paper or disturbing the entire pad.I usually have two or three post-it pads on my desk because I like the small ones and the big ones. This is a great solution. I will definitely be buying another when this pad runs out. . "I was excited to try these envelopes out.  I have been using peel and seal envelopes for a few years now and have tried several different types.  Unfortunately this doesn't seem to be the best out there and the price isn't low enough to overlook its flaws.The adhesive strip is very VERY narrow.  While it may be strong it certainly doesn't give me the confidence in it as some of its competitors that have an inch or so strip of adhesive.The flap that you pull up to expose the adhesive is also very narrow.  I keep finding that when I fold it up and run my finger over it to keep it up I end up running my finger against the already questionable adhesive.The security tint is sufficient.  The paper stock is good.  It is a decent envelope. I just prefer the types with a removable strip to expose the adhesive . "The convenience of pop-up post-it notes wherever you want them! I've always liked the pop up type of post-its and this makes it even more convenient because it doesn't have to be sitting on a flat surface (desk . "The pop up tape dispenser is such a simple thing yet it's amazing at the same time.The rubber band that wraps around your hand is comfortable. It's not too tight and stretchy enough that it would fit a wide range of hand sizes.The tape pops up on alternate sides (similar to how pop up post-its come out of that dispenser).I haven't had any issues with it jamming or with too many pieces coming out at once. One piece of precut tape is always ready.  You slide one side to open the dispenser and the pad of tape slides right in.It is perfect for projects using a lot of tape (craft projects
