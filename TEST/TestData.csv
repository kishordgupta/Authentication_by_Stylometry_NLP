2231,"I like the Swingline thermal photo lamination pouches. They seal fine. This is a good choice to preserve the photo that gets tucked up on the mirror, or pinned up on the wall. The price for a twenty-pouch pack seems reasonable, and is great for those who like to have some photo pouches on hand, but regular users may find a significant saving with bulk packages. These perform well for their intended purpose."
270,"While the glossy tape that I use at the office is good for keeping things together, it shows up very easily on gift wrap, being all shiny.  The matte or satin finsh on this is perfect for gifts..  doesnt attract or reflect light, so that you see the wrapping paper and not the tape. Very simple and it works.Con:  this type of tape is really for gift wrapping and isnt as attractive for normal everyday use, but it can be used as such.  Get both scotch gift tape and scotch regualr tape and you will have the right tape for the right occasion."
392,"I used this tape over the holidays for all my gift wrapping, and was very pleased with how it performed.First, it really does disappear on most gift wraps -- only on the shiniest foil wrap was I able to see the tape.  It has a subtle satin finish that just blends easily with ... well .. almost everything.  Second, it holds VERY securely.  If you're used to lesser tapes that let you carefully peel and reposition a flap, you'll soon find that this tape behaves differently.  Make sure you have things just where you want them before you stick down the tape.I would consider this a definite ""step up"" from my old stand-by, Scotch Magic Tape.  Definitely outperforms it by a long shot."
591,"Oh darn. I wanted to love this. I thought this was the one I purchased before. But this does not do well for 2-sided printing. It's so thin that the one side shows through the other. So that kind of defeats the brightness factor! If you just want cheap paper that prints fine on one side, this one will work, but if you want something that looks quality, you'll want to spend more for better."
395,"These pads have two strips of adhesive, so they stay put much better than others sticky notes.  The adhesive is at the top, like normal, and about half way between the bottom and the adhesive along the top.  The paper colors are nice too."
1811,"This is a really simple adjustment to a standard post-it style sticky note. A thin belt of glue in the middle of the note that helps to keep it flat against a surface - but takes away some of the ability to write on the back of the note.  A specialized item, no doubt, but I have found the sticky note stick'em is just not as strong as the Post-It note glue.  If you really need a flat stick, its better than nothing, but the poor lasting power of the note removes the benefits of the added strip to keep the note flat."
434,The Avery labels are a useful pad of sticky labels for multiple uses.  The solid pastel colors look nice and they peel from the pad easily and stick onto various surfaces.  I find them especially useful for labeling boxes I have stored in my closet so I remember what I put inside them.  It even sticks to clothing fairly well.  The tabs have perforations so they can be removed once you peel the label from the pad.  The only small downside is that they sort of peel off too easily once you stick them onto something.  Hopefully they don't just come off by themselves.  I have had that problem when buying generic Post-It notes.
599,"GP Spectrum Multi-Use Paper, 8.5 x 11 Inches, 3-Ream Pack (1500 Sheets) is a good paper and a fair price. Great with Amazon Prime Shipping, I highly recommend."
677,"These little tabs are decent--they're very durable and they come in many different colors. The only thing I have against them is that the tab part that you can write on is a little small. I've bought the Post-It note version of these things before, and they give you plenty of space to write on. These Avery tabs are still a good product, though!"
634,"When purchasing binders, one needs to consider the use you have intended for them.  There are two things I look at,  the cover and the rings.  As a teacher and a mom, I have a lot of experience with binders.The cover:If I am simply going to put papers in them and store them on the shelf, I like the hard binders.  I use this type for filing recipes and documents I need to access.  Since they are stiff they are easy to shove back onto the shelf.  In the classroom these also work better, as they are less likely to slip off the shelf than the flexible cover binders.However, I find that buying hard binders for my kids leads to problems.  The kids like to stuff these into their backpacks, and the edges where the plastic is sealed quickly start to peel off, and the covers get folded over.  For them, I have found that a flexible binder in general will make it farther though the school year.  They will sometimes crack along the spine, but usually not enough to make the binder unusable, and a little duct tape will fix it.The rings:The second thing to look at is the rings.  The best ones (in my opinion) are the D shaped, as they hold more, with the little dimple on one side that fits into a depression on the other side.  This prevents papers from getting caught as you flip through.  They also hurt less if you snap them onto your fingers!  The other closure (a zig zag) tends to get misaligned over time with hard use, and the sharp edges hurt more if you close them on your fingers.This binder has a clear front in which to slip a cover, and more importantly if you are filing on a shelf, an insert area along the spine.  I am a fan of this extra, and have found that printing on cardstock, then laying the binder on a flat surface makes it easy to insert the label .  It also has  circular rings but they  do have the more desirable dimple to hollow closure.  It will lay flat when open.  There are two clear plastic pockets on EACH inside, one taller and one shallower for shoving in some papers at the front and back  (since this is such a huge binder, the front pocket is actually extra wide) for a total of 4 pockets.  That is a nice addition.  The cover does have that wrinkled look."
1298,"This wrist rest is a great size for work with a desktop mouse. It supports the wrist without any pressure points. I have used a lot of different wrist rests for years, as they are important for ergonomic comfort.  The 3M Gel Wrist Rest does the job, it doesn't slip around on my desk. I have used it with my Steel Series mouse pad without problems. It's large enough to support larger wrists, but not too big for taking it with you on the road.  Has antimicrobial protection built in."
438,"I really liked these 3M Shipping Labels, permanent adhesive: I used them with the 5163 Avery template in Microsoft Word, with absolutely no problems!  They stuck very well both on cardboard and shipping tape: I have used Avery labels in the past and have really liked them, and these 3M labels seem to me to be a great substitute!  They were very easy-to-use, stuck well, the Avery template worked perfectly, and they stuck to the appropriate packaging well!I would definitely recommend these, especially if you are looking for a substitute for the Avery ones, without giving on the quality side: these are a nice thickness, without being too bulky, and are still easy to peel & adhere: loved them!"
1198,I have used some of these boxes for- long term storage- moving things from one house to another- `hauling boxes' to take books to a resellerWhat I like about these boxes- Quickly comes together to form box- Top is integrated into the box so there is not the problem of the missing top- Sturdy (holds heavy times such as books )- Handles provide an excellent comfortable grip even when filled with heavy itemsOnly draw back is the top/lid of the box does not lay completly flat.
481,This package of pens is a good deal for the price.  The ink flows well and the eight bright colors are great. These pens seem to be of about the same quality as the ones that you get from businesses with their advertising on them.  What I don't like is the grip.  The bottom end of the grip near the point of the pen is smooth and slippery.
1107,"Can't imagine why any 3M product would need to be reviewed.  I have used all kinds of 3M products thru the years and have always had great results.  With so many reviews I don't know what more I can say about this product.  Like so many reviews have mentioned these labels have more than one use.I'm not much into label making, so the printing instructions is a nice touch. But for labeling boxes, bins, etc. this is a nice size label. And of course, they're great for mailing packages.I do have a laser printer, so after learning about making labels and doing a little tweaking to the software, I had a printed label.This might become a habit for making address labels; a lot neater and definitely more professional. The labels are easy to take off and place on the package.  Make sure of the spot where you want to stick the label tho; once on, it's on."
484,"Terrific way to add a small notation and flag a page....all without ruining your book or script!  I've tried a few items in this new Avery line, all have been good, but this and the other removable label products are superior to anything else out there. This would be a wonderful tucked into a card or as a stocking stuffer. If you or someone you know likes reading inspirational or self help books, these are fun to mark pages!"
2117,"I use file folders for my home paperwork (bills, Amazon.com invoices;) and after buying new ones every year, I have now started to recycle them. These labels are perfect for re-labeling those files.They are also large enough to be used for title labels for other folders, like printing out a e-book. There are templates available from 3M's website that I downloaded and had no problem using or printing from them."
563,I like these file folder labels. I particularly like that there are 750 labels in a pack--that is very convenient and keeps me from constantly reordering the product.  I will look for more 3M office products.
289,"I'm a writer and have TONS and TONS of papers, documents, binders, and books to keep track of on a daily basis.  These Avery NoteTabs are super easy to use and look so much better than my previous solution of Post It Note flags (or cut-to-size post-it notes).  The advantages of the NoteTabs are easy to list:1.  Bright and colorful; easy to find your marked pages.2.  Rigid construction; they have the perfect thickness, just like regular index tabs.  Rigid enough to stay parallel with your pages; no limping or bending problems.3.  Repositionable; you can change your mind on placement as you add more tabs, moving each on the page to the spot that's ""just right"" for easy reading.4.  See-through plastic-like material for the ""sticky"" part of the index tab.  This means you can actually read through the area where the index tab is temporarily ""glued"" (or, alternatively, even write a note on the see-through part that's stuck to the page, if you need to cite something specific).5.  If you reposition the tab, it's my experience that the ink is not lifted with the glue and no sticky residue remains on the page at all.6.  Easy to write on the index tab with either ballpoint or felt tip pens--no smudging!  No more guessing as to WHY I actually flagged the page--I can write it on the index tab for easy reference & use color coding, thanks to the variety of colors available.These are a real winner; highly recommended!"
1543,"The kids in our house are tape-crazy, so I buy a lot of it, usually in bulk. They use it for art projects, for taping their pictures to windows, etc. I have on occassion bought the cheaper tape, the kind labeled with the name of big department stores like Target. Let me say emphatically - it's not worth it! It never comes off as easily because the gum on the tape comes off on whatever you put it on. I never have to worry about that with Scotch Tape."
1224,"Great pen that reminded me why rollerball pens are such an improvement over ballpoint. The ink flows beautifully. Pen has nice weight, matte finish, comes in a great little black box with elastic band. It would make for a great gift to anyone who loves a great writing instrument. The snake wrap-around also provides a nice accent."
1344,"I've been a long-time lover of fountain pens, but the often prohibitive pricing of the higher priced pens out there, or the just-not-good-enough quality of the budget-priced ones, pretty much brought my fountain pen shopping to a standstill a few years ago.I have to say that I was quite surprised to see that Pilot has stepped up to the plate with fountain pen offerings here in their MR Animal Collection line. I was even more surprised when I opened the very nicely made box that presents this budget-priced pen so well! The packaging is as nice as what I've received my more expensive (but still low-priced, in a $50 - $75 range) Waterman pens in, and the pen contained within is really quite lovely! I wouldn't say that its color is anything like a gold, as advertised, but it is quite close to the color pictured (about as close as one can expect going by the images displayed by a basic computer monitor). Overall, it's a lovely pen, and the lizard print accent enhances it, making it look more expensive, as opposed to cheap.The nib here writes just as well as any of my Mont Blanc or Waterman pens do, although I do have to admit to being partial to fine points, so my experience writing with a medium point is limited. One thing that has really taken me by surprise here is the converter! I'm used to the cumbersome, twist-to-fill converters that have come with every other fountain pen that I've ever owned, and this simple, squeeze-to-fill converter is really innovative! I'm kind of enchanted by it, really, and amazed that no other manufacturer (that I've encountered) ever thought to put something like this out! If it holds up well over time, it just might be a game-changer!The one thing that I didn't appreciate here was that my pen came with no information whatsoever. No warranty information, no instructions on refill model numbers, no contact information to purchase extra parts via, and worst of all if anyone new to fountain pens buys one of these and gets no insert - no information on how to fill the converter! I'm assuming that because my pen came to me in a different manner than most others looking at this will get theirs, perhaps that's why there was no enclosed information, but for anyone not sure of how to fill it with the converter, here's how:1. With the converter still attached to the nib - as it arrives packaged - squeeze the end of the converter where the metal tongue compresses the rubber ink chamber. Hold tongue in place, to ensure as much air as possible is squeezed out.2. Submerge the pen nib in a bottle of ink intended specifically for fountain pens.3. Release the tongue to fill.4. Wipe off the nib, and you're ready to write!Overall, for the presentation here and the pen itself, this is a REALLY great offering for less than twenty bucks! This is the sort of pen that allows anyone to walk around looking just a little more elegant in their workspace or home office, without having to worry about the exorbitant cost to replace this fountain pen if misplaced! Fountain pens add a touch of elegance to everything office-related, I think, and now having one like this available - made by Pilot, and at such a fair price - puts that extra touch within everyone's reach!"
1101,"I looked forward to using these for moving and temporarily storing prized china dishes downstairs while we renovate the dining room. Although they aren't moving far, they still need to be packed for any long move.  The box was reinforced enough to make it not seem like breaking apart with just a little weight.  I liked the handles on the unit as it made carrying what would otherwise be an awkward size to handle.  Most impressed with how the boxes quickly fold back down once you're done so you can reuse these in the future by conveniently storing them in the closet."
721,"When I first opened this pen up, I was immediately impressed with the style, quality feel, and the smooth writing.As a programmer, I spend all day in front of a computer; but, I think better when I write things out in a notepad on my desk - so I do a lot of writing.Anyway, even with the positive first impression, I found this pen wasn't suited to heavy use.  The twist mechanism started coming apart after just a couple of days - and the point doesn't always come out correctly.  It's hard to explain since the pen doesn't appear to be broken, but the twist mechanism just didn't hold up very well.I've also found that, although this pen definitely performs better than a cheap ballpoint, I've used quite a few pens that write better as well.Overall, if you're looking for a stylish pen for light usage, I think this pen is probably a perfect choice.  If, like me, you use a pen all day long - I'd probably pass on this and look elsewhere."
3169,These boxes worked great for moving my office supplies from one floor to another. They are sturdy and I like how easily they go together and also break down for future use. You could easily use these boxes over and over again without ruining them by the buckling. Love them!
1860,"Most of us have started using post-its or other paper flags to note the spots in a book, file, or record which we need to get back to quickly.  Unfortunately, they're not made for this, and as a result are not very durable.  After a few reads, the book or file ends up looking very shabby, and the paper tags fold such that notes written on them can't reliably be found on the fly.These NoteTabs, while removeable, do not tear, and can be clearly marked so that they can substitute for an actual file divider.I especially like these tabs for noting my favorites in cookbooks, and unlike some similar items, all are useful as tabs, making the price reasonable."
689,"Hello, my name is Tamara and I'm a book abuser.  However, thanks to Avery's NoteTabs, I haven't committed much abuse for nearly a month.  I'm also swearing a lot less.I'm a writer, and while researching I highlight passages, write in the margins, dog-ear pages, and commit a number of other atrocities.  Post-It Notes get trashed or lost. Bookmarks don't stand a chance, but these plastic NoteTabs are able to withstand my torture and thrive.The NoteTabs are perforated. The top one has a tab that marks a page and you can use it whole for long notes that stay put but lift off easily, or you can take them apart.  While tabs on the lower sections might be nice, they still work just fine and also allow me to highlight/note-take on several parts of the same page.What I don't use for marking up research books, I use to edit manuscript pages.  Editing on a computer is no fun -- to do it right, I like to print out a copy and edit by hand. Being able to see through the notes is invaluable.  It's especially useful with heavy editing.I've also been using the tabbed sections to mark everything from the page of whatever novel I'm reading, to masses of papers that need filing.  They'd be terrific in cookbooks.I'll be buying lots more of these! As Tony the Tiger says, they're great!"
249,This is a sturdy box for our heavier items like books and kitchenware.  I agree with the other reviewer that it was a bit difficult to figure out how to fold the box.  We plan to use it as a temporary storage box once we move in.
1708,If I were going to move I would definitely buy these boxes to pack with. They are very simple to assemble with a few simple and numbered in order folds. No tape needed and handles to boot! They are very sturdy and easy to stack since you can get all the same size. The large and medium would be my choices for moving but the smaller size makes a great storage box for income tax stuff. They have a place to write the room and contents of the box. If using for income tax records and business papers they make storage much neater then those accordion type folders that fall apart and self destruct after a year of filing. I would recommend these for anyone needing a neat way to store annoying paperwork or someone needing moving boxes for more delicate items that can't be piled heavy. Great item!
2718,"This is one of those things that you didn't realize you needed until you try it (of course, after trying it you still might decide you don't need it)That is to say, it could be considered a ""acquired taste"" and therefore I would't recommend it to everyone.I'd suggest that they are best for avid readers or people doing research.They are basically sticky notes which are transparent and have adhesive over the entire back side.  You can write on them with pencil, pen, etc.I tend to highlight and jot notes in many books - cookbooks, business reference, hobby, self help, etc. etc...Sometimes these books aren't mine (borrowed or library books)  If that's the case, out come the sticky notes.When I first tried these I was afraid they would smudge with either a rollerball or gel ink pen, but was pleasantly surprised that they didn't.  If you use pencil, you can easily erase.I also use this as a marker on my wall calendar to note which day it is.  As I have a lot of notes on my calendar, I still want to see what's under my highlight.I'm used to using various sizes of sticky notes and having to place them approximately where I want to write or memo something.I'd probably give it 3-1/2 stars if that were an option - the additional deduction based on cost.  These are not cheap.Disclosure: I received these through Amazon Vine.If this review was helpful or if you have any questions, please let me know!"
1043,"I have been a Georgia Pacific fan for years and it is such a pleasure to be able to buy it by less than a case.  For me, three reams are better than a 10 pack.  The brightness is quite satisfactory and the poundage is the same.  I have had no jams compared to some paper products that jam the printer's paper route.I would reconsider sending r&eacute;sum&eacute;s on this type of paper in lieu of a higher brightness and poundage paper only because I believe in that first impression is so important and I would not want a piece of paper to be a downer.  This is the type of paper I would send to my Congressman or Senator.I rate this as &#34;I'll be back in a few months for a reorder&#34; product and recommend it with ease."
1161,"I've tried several 3M injet label products and have been well-pleased with all of them. These are substantial labels on nice backing paper. The sheets stay flat and feed easily, and the inverse cutouts from the die-cuts have been removed so the labels are very fast and easy to remove from backing. Good adhesive, nice weight. I've used the on plastic bags and paper, and they have a good hold, even in lower temperatures. I've preferred the 3M label products to both store brand & Avery. These work with Avery templates in Word."
3261,"These are thick.  I am using them as chapter tabs in a textbook, and I like the way they look.  Ballpoint pen ink glides on smoothly too.Product details from packaging are as follows:2"" x 1-1/2"" NoteTabs-turns pages like a divider-made extra thick for reliable, long-lasting use-won't damage documents or lift ink (results may vary...)Made in China (Personally, I consider shipping these from China to be a huge negative, hence the loss of a star.)"
570,"Pen arrived in a gift box with a fabric lining.  Seemed fancier than I was expecting for this pen - considering the cost.  The pen itself is quite heavy which is nice.  The animal print though seems a little misplaced.  It's not terrible but it seems like it doesn't match the pen to me.The ink comes out smooth and fine.  No globby messes.  It's very nice to hold and use.The cap comes off and sticks on the back so you don't lose it when writing, however make sure you put that on securely or it whips off the end.  That isn't the fault of the pen, it's my fault for not pushing it on harder."
694,"For gift wrapping & other instances where you'd like tape to not be so visible, this stuff is great!  I've actually used it on wooden picture frames & wooden press board furniture that had dents in it to just help maintain integrity.  There's probably a better fix, but it works for me.  Scotch knows how to make tape & this tape is no exception."
573,"A bit on the thin side, and they are see-thru (so don't try to recycle it by using the other side for a new label, unless you put white paper behind it.)  That they are ""removable"" is convenient if you have to change your tab dividers from time to time, but after several uses, they don't always stick so well anymore.I personally didn't find I had much use for them, since if I stick on a tab divider, I usually plan on it staying there indefinitely.  I use the permanent tabs more often."
772,"The satin finish is supposed to make this more invisible than regular ""Magic"" tape when used on gift wrap.  To my eyes, there is almost no difference.  So the only reason to get this is if the price is better than regular ""Magic"" tape.  As I write this review, it is!To be clear, there's nothing WRONG with this tape.  It works just as well as regular ""Magic"" tape.  It's very hard to see when applied.  And, I assume, it'll have the same remarkable durability as regular ""Magic"" tape.  It's just that it's special feature (satin finish, more invisible on gift wrap) doesn't work."
574,"I like this large pack of file folder labels.  They go through the printer well.  Since the package is large, I won't run out in the middle of a project.  They stick well and look great."
377,"3M has done it again! Another innovative and very useful product using Scotch Tape. How many times have you wrestled with a package that needed to be taped and attempted to juggle the box while you attempted to pull a length of tape off the dispenser to place on the package? I know I have had this problem many, many times and especially at Christmas with the flimsy wrapping paper. Well, 3M has solved the problem with the handheld dispenser that has a band to wrap around your hand. That's just half of the helpful things... the other half is a Deskgrip... this dispenser grips the surface of your desk or table and you simply lift the pre-cut strip. This handy package has two of each type of dispenser.. four in all... plus six pre-cut sets of tape strips refills. What a great convenience for the home or office."
454,"I wrap a lot of gifts at the holiday season.  I am more into wrapping with wrapping patterned paper than the expensive option of gift bags.  So I tend to be very picky when it comes to my paper and tape.  I love this tape, I've been buying it for a few years.  It is actually a little bit more shiny than the regular Scotch tape, but blends into wrapping paper better than regular Scotch tape.  I used to use the double stick tape, but that was getting too expensive, especially with the kids just ripping off the paper quicker than you can say ""boo"".  I am the one who cares so much about how the finished gift wrapping looks, yes I admit that.  But when giving a gift to someone other than my own family, looks do mean a lot.  I spent a lot of time deciding what to give this person, so when I wrap it, I want it to look like I care.  So I use this tape.I like to think that fingerprints don't seem to show as easily as regular Scotch tape, but that may just be wishful thinking.  It seems that with this Gift Wrap tape, the actual adhesive on the film is more microscopic so you can't see the texture like you do with regular Scotch tape.As far as the 3 roll thing, I much prefer to buy a regular roll and put it into a dispenser.  The flimsy dispenser that the rolls come in in the 3 roll pack are very basic.  The length of tape you get with the 3 roll pack is a lot shorter than a single roll, so if you have many gifts to wrap, then consider buying more of the single rolls.  Another reason you might like the single roll is because the serrated edge for the tape cutter is much more crude than a heavy desktop tape dispenser or even a regular plastic dispenser.  I prefer the weight of the desktop tape dispenser when wrapping a lot of gifts.  Its a bit easier to tear off the tape with that weight in it, and it's more of a one handed job than a two handed job."
411,"I really love the bright vibrant colors that these sheets come in and the sure sticking factor I get with these Post-it labels is fantastic.I used to send away for my return address stickers,then I discovered these wonderful thingies!By going to the website listed on the pack,I get the Free templates to use in making labels that look better and importantly Stick better than my old choices.These labels look wonderful and I Love them!"
698,"I picked this product to review because I recently purchased a 2010 planner that does not have dividers for each month.  I thought these might come in handy, so that I can use these to divide my planner by the months.I like the roundness of the label--easier to spot in my planner, but you would need to write really small for these to work, unless you didn't need to write on the colored part of the label, which I do.  I also think I would prefer a brighter color, to make them stand out.  These are pastel colors.  The colored part of the label is just alittle too small for me.These do seem very durable, where the more transparent part of the label is, and more room to write there too.It might be fun to think of all the useful ways a person can use these.  They are a definite improvement over regular dividers!"
1113,"I wish these are more reusable but I guess I can't ask for too much.It's sticky but if you carry around your binder or notebook too much when you go from place to place, it might lose its grip.I do like that it's big enough to write real words on them. I write largely and I've always disliked the small tabs."
775,"I have 5 November birthdays and each of them got a few presents.  This Scotch tape is perfect.  It tears off nicely and when you put it on your packages, you can't even notice it's there.  Scotch is the only brand I ever got but they improved the quality of this tape by making it invisible.Also, the price on Amazon is great.  I highly recommend it if you are fussy with your packages like I am."
1871,"Papers, files, notebooks,textbooks, bills, folders, you name it, we have it in our desks at work, school and at home.  Enter these nifty little see-through note tabs by AVERY and your search for the right page is over!  This pack of 40 tabs, each measuring a generous 2"" x 1 1/2"", will make organizing papers a snap.  Write on the tab or highlight text beneath it and you'll be able to see through it; place it anywhere on your page, even reposition without causing rips, peels.  In most cases, it won't cause ink lifts either.  They are both easy to see in bright neon colors, and very durable, withstanding repeated turns.  Other flimsy tabs don't measure up to the quality of these AVERY labels; I highly recommend them for all your organizational projects."
1430,"These tags come in handy for organizing my craft supplies and patterns.  Obviously, they can be used for all sorts of organizing.  The colors are nice, cool blues and modern greens.  They add color while being useful.  I'd recommend."
658,"Extremely durable, not too sticky but still hold great. Bright, attractive color. Great for reminders/organizing your workflow. I do think the price is too high, though, for the product."
71,"Every Avery label I have ever tried I loved and this one is no different.  Instead of writing on your file folders, just insert these correctly into your inkjet or laser printer, select the Avery 5366 template, type in what you want, and print.  The labels can fit three lines of text comfortably if you were planning to use them as address labels instead of just for folders.  However, the length is really designed for folders. Of course if you decrease your font size, you might be able to squeeze a fourth line on the label.MS Word 2007 already has the template for these labels.  You can download the template from the Avery site if your version of Word doesn't have this template by default."
813,"I give the tape itself 5 stars -it is fantastic, and is really the best tape to use on wrapping paper, because it does a great job of disappearing.  It is MUCH better, in fact, than the typical Scotch tape which can be removed and reused if not put on correctly --and which is not fully see through.  Though that tape also does a great job when used for wrapping, the Satin Finish tape is better.The only problem I had is that I was really surprised at how little tape came on each of these three rolls; it was ridiculous.  I had a ""regular"" single roll of Scotch Satin Tape and the tape on THAT roll was at LEAST three times the diameter of the tape on each of these 3-pack rolls.  So, the bottom line is that these three rolls of tape seem to have less tape than a single roll of the regular sized Scotch Satin Tape.  Basically if you like to have more rolls of tape lying around (for example, useful if other people are helping you wrap) AND the three rolls are cheaper, together, than a single roll, then go for the three rolls.  If, however, you like having less clutter, less wasting of resources (more plastic going into the garbage), and NOT running out of tape in the middle of wrapping, go for the single roll.  (The single roll also has the advantage of having a stronger case -and is sealed on both the front and the back.You can't go wrong with the quality of this product, just with the amount of waste, and the amount of tape you get for your money.Recommended as a single roll.  Not recommended as a three pack unless multiple people are wrapping at the same time."
417,"I really liked these tabs.  They are sturdy and very easy to use.  They can easily be peeled off and replaced.  I found these very useful in organizing my teaching materials into 3-ring binders.  I highly recommend these for home, school and office applications!"
1517,I have a couple of notebooks that I use where I have put the pages into plastic sleeves because I have to refer to them so often.  The problem is. . . regular dividers don't stick-out far enough on the edges because I use plastic sleeves.  But these tabs are the perfect thing so I know where each section is located!  I'm sure that they can be used for books and other things as well.
1759,"This is a very comfortable pen to hold and to use, as the point moves with unusual smoothness. The crocodile patterned band in the middle adds elegance, as does the presentation box.  This would be a useful, inexpensive, but stylish gift for a coworker."
1173,"3M seems to have Avery's dominant position in the printable specialty label sheets business very much in the cross hairs. These feed well through standard printers, stick well to paper folders and are everything this simple product should be. I do, however, wish that 3M had removed the bits of paper between the labels on the label sheet like they do for many of their other printable label products. Note that these are Made in the USA, which matters some to me if not to everyone. The last several packages of Avery products I previously purchased were all Made in China."
382,No problems printing with a laser printer on these labels.  Avery templates in Word lined up perfectly.  Adhesive is strong.  Price seems comparable to other brands.  These labels will certainly meet your needs.
386,"I have a number of 3M wrist wrests/pads, and I love almost all of them.  Over the years, I have tried just about every type of material out there.Gel is the most comfortable to me, and I've found gels are not always the same softness.  This one is just right.This review is for the 18"" one.  It is on the smaller side for compact spaces or keyboards.  It also works fine on larger, full-size keyboards, though.What I really like about this one is that it is tapered from front to back which matches the angle of keyboards.  It is very comfortable.As mentioned, I have several 3M wrist rests.  This one is leatherette.  It is more comfortable than I would have thought.  My other ones are the fabric covered ones.  This one, therefore, may cause more sweat/grunge build-up, but it is vastly easier to clean than the fabric ones.  I feel that the gel in the 3M antimicrobial FABRIC covered wrist rests is a bit too firm, while the non-antimicrobial FABRIC one is more like this one (my preference).One final comment is that 3M puts a very good ""sticky"" plastic on the bottom.  The wrist rest does not slide around a bit.  The plastic is like the vinyl press-apply decals.  It does a great job.  Never marred any surface I've used them on such as wood, Formica, etc.Just an excellent wrist pad!"
584,"No one likes to move, and one of the pains of doing so is finding boxes in order to packing your stuff.  Every time we have moved or helped someone else move, it seems they always come up short on boxes or more often short on packing tape.  Seems like one person always manages to cut themselves on the packing tape dispenser, too.Fellowes came up with a fantastic design on their SmoothMove boxes, making packing tape completely unnecessary.  These boxes are easy to make, extremely sturdy, and reusable many times over.  We have already used them twice for moving friends and family and everyone liked them.  Most boxes you get do not have handles, but this feature makes these even more desirable because they are easier to carry.  The boxes also have preprinted sections for writing what room they go in and what the contents are.  While this can impact the ability to reuse them, we have always used a numbering system instead of a naming system.  For instance, the living room is #1 and the master bedroom is #2, and so forth.  We usually write the detailed location of where the contents belong on the contents section, such as ""kitchen pantry"" or ""jack's dresser"".  The boxes are a little pricey, but the convenience, reliability and usability make them a very worthwhile investment.  Other sizes are also available depending on your needs."
1567,"I've been using these tabs to create dividers in my textbooks and cookbooks.They are great and very useful when the pages of your books are not highlight or notetaking friendly.They come off easily in my most delicate textbooks without damaging the pages, so you can sell your book back at the end of the semester without a problem.Nice colors, great size, very useful.The price could be lower, however."
587,"The adhesive on this is similar to post it notes. The adhesive covers the entire back of the label except for a small tear-off portion on the side which makes pulling each piece off the pad easy.I love that there are three different colors on each pad.I have a Brother P-touch label printer and I will definitely be using these as a quicker alternative.My only reservation is that I am not sure how long the adhesive will hold. If you put it on a piece of paper, file folder, etc and bend it, the label's corner starts to lift off."
824,"I recently testedScotch Magic(TM) Tape 3105, 3/4-inch x 300 Inches, 3-Packagainst Scotch's(R) Satin Finish Gift-wrap tape.  Both were both 3/4 inches wide.You can't go wrong with either of these products!  They both came in the very familiar and proven dispensers - nothing fancy, and they just work well.I was surprised to see that the Matte Finish product was actually more invisible than the Satin Finish Gift-wrap product - but unless you saw them side by side, you'd never know.The Satin Finish Gift Wrap Tape did allow me to easily remove or reposition the tape.  Either way, find the best price, keep it simple, and use either of these tape products - you will not be disappointed!"
2857,"Avery NoteTabs stylishly and sturdily replace flimsy tabs, no-longer-sticky sticky notes, and dog earred bits of paper and index cards.I used these in my moleskine to more effectively divide my notebook up into usable, more functional, and more organized resource.The NoteTabs have a more permanent feel than any other solutions I have tried- the plastic is stiff and has a pleasant lightly textured feel.  The adhesive is very grippy and I trust it more than the previous strips of post it note I had resorted to useing.  These also look much more professional and neat which for me is important as I often take my moleskine with me on appointments.  The plastic easily accepts writing and doesn't destroy pens or smudge the way many plastics do- Avery calls this a paper overlay but whatever it is it's almost magically integrated into their products).I do like the colors- nice and fresh, though the package would be much more useful had they included more colors in the colorway rather than just two, as many folks use color coding to organize and move them quickly through their materials. Though if color coding is that important folks can buy the other colors Avery offers."
